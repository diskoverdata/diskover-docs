# Introduction

An unparalleled data management solution, Diskover consolidates in a global index unstructured data spread across heterogeneous repositories. Cutting-edge analytical tools combined with uniquely fast search capabilities empower all levels of an organization to have their own relationship with data, resulting in informed decision making, significant operating costs reduction, along with enhanced workflows and their monetization.

The Diskover Data curation platform addresses the growing complexity associated with managing unstructured data in a hybrid environment. While the unstructured data management problem has been around for some time, the complexity is skyrocketing due to recent developments. The move to the cloud accelerated over the last year due to COVID-19, remote workers, and the overall view that cloud is more viable these days. Large organizations have now adopted and leveraged hybrid cloud models.

Since unstructured data management is even more critical and complicated than ever before, there is a significant increase and interest in solutions that address the growing complexity of data fragmentation, across both physical data storage and cloud repositories.

Diskover embraced the logical approach of being open-source, as well as integrating other open-source platforms like Elasticsearch and Kibana, as open platforms are more powerful and highly integrative, wide-spread, mature, developed around transparency and trust, and help organizations become more agile and collaborative in their data innovation.

The scale out platform supports comprehensive search, data analysis, tagging, and scheduled tasks capabilities to enhance data management, enable automation in file-based workflows, and therefore improve the efficiency of the organization and its people, in addition to reducing storage cost.

## Diskover Data Curation Use Cases

Diskover addresses the organization and integration of unstructured data stored across a variety of storage repositories from Linux  and Windows  filesystems to S3 based storage. Inefficient data management often results in:

- Difficulty relating unstructured data to business objectives (adding value or decreasing risk).
- Reduced findability of files.
- Decreased production and inefficient workflow problems.
- Scalability of people and processes with incredibly high rate of data growth.
- Significant increase in man-hours.
- Increase of data storage costs.

Data curation  often involves annotation, publication, and presentation of the data such that the value of the data is maintained over time, and the data remains available for reuse and preservation. Data curation encompasses the manual and automated processes needed for principled and controlled data creation, maintenance, and management, together with the capacity to add value to data. The rapid growth of unstructured data has required a transition of traditional human curation tasks to more automated and scalable processes. Furthermore, the curation process often involves many “data stakeholders” in the process, each with different use cases. Diskover addresses the use cases of the various data stakeholders.
