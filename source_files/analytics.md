## Analytics

### Overview

Diskover provides powerful reporting capabilities. Reports can be generated to align with business context and can be constructed from any Elasticsearch query. Therefore, any combination of attributes from the [metadata catalog](#metadata_catalog) (names, tags, project status, etc.) can be used to construct business-facing reports.

Diskover offers professional services to assist with setting up custom reports - please [contact us](mailto:sales@diskoverdata.com) for details.

Below is a summary of the current analytics/reports available. The links will bring you to the [Diskover User Guide](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/) giving detailed information regarding how to use these analytics. In the following sections, we will take a deep dive into the **‚öôÔ∏è customizable analytics**.

### Smart Searches

#### Overview

Smart Searches provide a mechanism to create repeatable reports or bookmarks based on search queries. Any combination of names, tags, metadata fields, etc., can be used to construct business-facing reports. Any users can access Smart Searches, but only authorized users can customize by adding, editing, or deleting queries.

#### Smart Searches Examples

Here are a few examples providing business-context insight.

**Example with storage tiers**:

**Example using file kinds**:

**Example using customers**:

<img src="images/analytics_smart_searches_by_customers.png" width="">

#### Smart Searches Customization

üî¥ &nbsp;To customize, start by clicking the **Edit Smart Searches** button:

<img src="images/analytics_smart_searches_edit.png" width="850">

üî¥ &nbsp;This page will open in a new tab:

- Read all the instructions at the top for guidance.
- Modify the [search queries](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#manual-queries-syntax-and-rules) for your use case(s).
- Click **Save Smart Searches** to save your queries once done.

<img src="images/analytics_smart_searches_edit_mode.png" width="">

Here is a simple example of queries mostly using **customer names** + specific **paths**/repositories + **tags**:

#### Overview

Reports provide a mechanism to create repeatable analytics by searching for your top unknowns, from simple queries like "which file types occupy the most space" to "who is using the most space". Any users can access Reports, but only authorized users can customize by adding, editing, or deleting queries.

#### Reports Examples

#### Reports Customization

‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp;Note that multiple queries can be used for this analytics and selected via the drop-down menu:

üî¥ &nbsp;To customize, start by clicking the **Edit Reports** button:

<img src="images/analytics_reports_edit.png" width="850">

üî¥ &nbsp;This page will open in a new tab:

- Read all the instructions at the top for guidance. This report is a little more complicated to customize, so take the time to read the instructions and then test your queries.
- Modify the [search queries](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#manual-queries-syntax-and-rules) for your use case(s).
- Click **Save Reports** to save your queries once done.

#### Overview

Cost reporting can be generated to align with business context and can be constructed from any Elasticsearch [query](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#manual-queries-syntax-and-rules). Therefore, any combination of names, tags, metadata fields, etc. can be used to construct business-facing reports.

Storage cost can be set globally or per storage volume, directory, etc. This tool is designed to control operating costs by 1) charging clients accurately for storage of their projects and 2) clean-up/data incentivizing.

#### Calculation of Cost Estimates

The storage costs can either be estimated globally, by storage volume, or down a directory level. The estimations need to be done outside of Diskover. Beside the cost of the storage itself, other factors can be compounded like electricity, service contract, System Administrator‚Äôs salary, subscription fees, etc. The estimations need to be calculated and configured per gigabyte.

#### Configuration of Storage Costs

Storage costs can be configured to run at index time or as a post-index process. Follow the help text instructions in **DiskoverAdmin**:

- To run costs at time of index: **Configuration ‚Üí Diskover ‚Üí Configurations ‚Üí Default**
- To run costs as a post-index process: **Configuration ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Post Index ‚Üí Costs**

#### Where to Find Costs in the User Interface

- **Analytics ‚Üí Cost Analysis**, which is the report discussed in this section.

- **Analytics ‚Üí User Analysis**

- **File search page** ‚Üí Cost column in the search results pane - if that column is not visible:
    - Go to **DiskoverAdmin ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Web ‚Üí General** ‚Üí then go to **Expose Extra Fields from Index and Post-Index Plugins**
    - The **cost** column might need to be exposed by users, from the interface go to **‚õ≠ ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Hide fields in search results**


#### Cost Analysis Examples

Here are a few examples providing business-context insight.

**Example by Project**:
