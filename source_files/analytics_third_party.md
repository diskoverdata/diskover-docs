### Third-Party Analytics

You can optionally use third-party analytical tools, such as [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com), [Grafana](https://grafana.com), [PowerBI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi), and others, to read the Elasticsearch metadata library besides Diskover-Web. Diskover does not technically support these optional tools, and only the installation of Kibana is described in this section.

#### Using Kibana in Addition to Diskover-Web

##### Kibana v7 via RPM

- Note that Kibana v7 can only be used with Elasticsearch v7.
- For securing Elasticsearch and Kibana, [follow this user guide to set up security](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/secure-cluster.html), as by default, Elasticsearch has no security enabled: 

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Install the latest version of Kibana and keep up to date with patches, security enhancements, etc. as new versions are released:
```
yum install -y https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-7.12.0-x86_64.rpm
vi /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Uncomment and set the following line:
```
server.host: "<host ip>"
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Uncomment and set the following line if Elasticsearch is not listening on localhost:
```
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://<es host ip>:9200"]
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Set firewall rules if applicable:
```
firewall-cmd --add-port=5601/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Start and enable the Kibana service:
```
systemctl enable kibana.service
systemctl start kibana.service
systemctl status kibana.service
```
