## Architecture Overview and Resources Requirements
___

The following images provide a high-level overview of the Diskover scale-out architecture. Diskover's deployment uses 3 major components:

- **Elasticsearch Cluster(s)**
- **Diskover-Web**
- **Diskover's Indexers/Task Workers**

It is recommended to separate the Elasticsearch node/cluster, web server, and indexing host(s). The indexers should ideally be using SSD. NFS data stores do not usually perform well for indices.

Out of the box, Diskover efficiently scans generic filesystems. However, in todayâ€™s complex IT architectures, files are often stored across a variety of repositories. To address this, Diskover offers various [alternate scanners](https://diskoverdata.com/products/indexers/) as well as provides a robust foundation for [building alternate scanners](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_dev_guide/#develop-your-own-alternate-scanner), enabling comprehensive indexing of any file storage location.
