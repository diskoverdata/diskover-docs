## Alternate Scanners Configuration

### Overview

Out of the box, Diskover efficiently scans generic filesystems. However, in today‚Äôs complex IT architectures, files are often stored across a variety of repositories. To address this, Diskover provides a robust foundation for building alternate scanners, enabling comprehensive scanning of any file storage location.

In addition, Diskover offers a wide range of metadata harvest plugins, enriching indexed data with valuable business context attributes and supporting workflows that enable targeted data organization, retrieval, analysis, and enhanced workflow. These plugins can run at [indexing](#config_plugins_index) or [post-indexing](#config_plugins_post_index) intervals, balancing comprehensive metadata capture with high-speed scanning.

‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp;**IMPORTANT!** After configuring an alternate scanner, you must create and schedule a task in the [Task Panel](#task_panel) to ensure it runs properly.

| Learn more | [Visit our website](https://diskoverdata.com/products/indexers/) and/or [contact Diskover](mailto:sales@diskoverdata.com) |
| Purpose | <p>Organizations often preserve their assets/intellectual properties within tape-based archives systems like the Atempo Miria platform. The Diskover Atempo Scanner is designed to scan all the files within the Atempo Miria archive system and presents them as a volume within the Diskover user interface.</p><p>Additional attributes are added as properties to the file during the indexing process, such as tape number, media type, etc. Therefore, the files and their rich attributes become searchable and reportable, as well as engaged in automated workflows.</p> |



<p id="alt_scanner_azure"></p>

#### Azure Blob

| Purpose | <p>While you can cost-effectively store and access unstructured data at scale with Microsoft Azure blob storage, searching through multiple accounts or blob containers is not possible from the Azure interface. The Storage Explorer portal doesn't allow users to search all folders at once, plus you need to know the exact file name you are looking for as wild cards are not permitted either.</p><p>Diskover offers the Azure blob storage scanner allowing you to scan petabytes of data at blazing speed. In turn, you can easily find any file with a single query, whether that file is located in an Azure blob or any other volumes indexed with Diskover.</p><p>Note that attributes are collected during this process. These extra fields become searchable, reportable for analysis, and actionable, allowing for potential upstream file management, manually or via automated scheduled tasks.</p> |

| Purpose | The DirCache alternate scanner can be used to speed up subsequent crawls when scanning slower network-mounted storage. DirCache uses an SQLite database to store a local cache of directories' mtimes (modified times), directories' file lists, and file stat attributes. On subsequent crawls, when a directory mtime is the same as in the cache, the directory list and all file stat attributes can be retrieved from the cache rather than over the network mount. |
