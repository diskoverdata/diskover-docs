The Xytech Media Operations Platform order status plugin is designed to automate the correlation of the order management system and the storage system, by harvesting key business context from Xytech and applying that context within the AJA Diskover Media Edition. In turn, this business context metadata can be used to automate workflows, curate data, monitor costs, create highly customized reports, and search granularly.

Facilities often manually correlate the order management system with the storage repositories. However, manual processes are subject to human errors and difficult to scale as the volume of media orders and data turnover increases constantly.

Therefore, the lack of integration for file-based workflows between the order management system and the underlying storage repositories, makes data management decisions difficult as they are solely based on attributes of files or objects on storage. Additional business context is needed from the order management system to increase precision and accuracy of data management decisions.

An instance of key information might be the invoice date for a work order. A status change for a work order can be aa key indicator for data management, for example, once a Xytech media order has been ‚Äúinvoiced‚Äù, then the data associated with that media order can be a candidate for archival.

##### Overview

The IMF package validator plugin allows organizations to validate IMF packages before delivery from a remote platform, saving immense amounts of man-hours over the course of a business year.

Oxagile‚Äôs IMF Package Validator Plugin, exclusively designed for the AJA Diskover Media Edition, allows users to scan and validate IMF packages before delivery from any location, regardless of the location of the IMF package data.

IMF stands for Interoperable Master Format, which is a technical standard used in the Media and Entertainment industry for the exchange of digital content between different platforms and systems. The IMF format is used by content creators, distributors, and broadcasters to deliver high-quality video content to a variety of devices, including TVs, mobile devices, and web browsers.

Netflix, for example, requires all their content to be delivered in IMF format, which undergoes rigorous validation to ensure compliance with industry standards. The validation process involves extensive testing of the content's video, audio, and metadata to ensure that it meets the technical specifications and can be delivered to viewers in the highest quality possible.

Once the content has been validated, it is then encoded into various formats, including 4K and HDR, and made available for streaming on various platforms. The IMF validation process is a critical step in the content delivery pipeline.

##### Trial and Purchase of the Plugin

The IMF Package Validator plugin is developed and sold exclusively by [Oxagile](https://www.oxagile.com/), a major technological partner working with both Diskover Data and [AJA Video Systems](https://www.aja.com/). For more information, to start a 30 day trial, or to purchase the IMF Package Validator plugin, please contact [Oxagile](mailto:IMF@Oxagile.com).

Post facilities often have customers‚Äô assets that have been archived and lack findability, visibility, and searchability, and therefore, the opaque nature of these assets makes them difficult to reuse or repurpose. Companies with years of such archived assets have often stored these on tape media or removable hard drives, which are often stored in a physical vault.

Assets were often stored on such ‚Äúoffline‚Äù media due to costs; however, with the advent of cloud and object storage, the economics are now making it viable to store such vaulted assets on more ‚Äúonline media‚Äù. Although, simply putting these assets onto online media does not necessarily make these assets findable in context or within the facility‚Äôs order management system.

The Xytech asset creation tool is designed to find and index newly restored online assets from LTO tapes, removable hard drives, etc., making them available, findable, and searchable within the Xytech order management system, as well as Diskover.

The plugin operates on the assumption that the assets restored to online media are placed into a folder with the following naming convention: **CustomerID_CustomerName**

The path location is added to the asset within Xytech and the asset number is assigned to the file via a tag within the Diskover Index.

##### Overview

The BAM info plugin is designed to enable additional metadata collection for BAM (Binary Alignment Map) and SAM (Sequence Alignment Map) about a file without granting the Diskover user any read/write file system access. The BAM info plugin enables additional metadata for the SAM and BAM file formats to be harvested at time of index, and are therefore searchable, reportable, actionable, and can be engaged in workflows within Diskover.

- The specification for the SAM file format can be found here:
  [https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)
- The BAM info plugin uses the Python **pysam** to harvest attributes about the BAM and SAM files:
  [https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

New indices will use the plugin, and any SAM or BAM file will get additional info added to the Elasticsearch index‚Äôs **bam_info** field. The attributes provide the ability to view storage and file system content from a workflow perspective, for example, all the frame rates on any given storage.

The Grant Plugin has a dual purpose 1) assisting research institutes in managing their grants/members/storage costs internally, and 2) fulfilling the requirements for the new NIH DMS Policy.

The Grant Plugin collects and parses grants‚Äô metadata (grant number, group ID, etc.) to curated datasets. In turn, staff associated with a specific grant has visibility/searchability of their limited data/grant without access to the source files or other grants. That extra metadata is also available to use for further workflow automation if needed.
