#### Overview

The BAM info plugin is designed to enable additional metadata collection for BAM (Binary Alignment Map) and SAM (Sequence Alignment Map) about a file without granting the Diskover user any read/write file system access. The BAM info plugin enables additional metadata for the SAM and BAM file formats to be harvested at time of index, and are therefore searchable, reportable, actionable, and can be engaged in workflows within Diskover.

- The specification for the SAM file format can be found here:
  [https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)
- The BAM info plugin uses the Python **pysam** to harvest attributes about the BAM and SAM files:
  [https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

New indices will use the plugin, and any SAM or BAM file will get additional info added to the Elasticsearch index‚Äôs **bam_info** field. The attributes provide the ability to view storage and file system content from a workflow perspective, for example, all the frame rates on any given storage.
