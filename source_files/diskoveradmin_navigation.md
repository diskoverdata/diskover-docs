| **DirCache**  | Diskover | Alternate Indexers | The DirCache alternate scanner can be used to speed up subsequent crawls when indexing slower network-mounted storage. DirCache uses an SQLite database to store a local cache of directories' mtimes (modified times), directories' file lists, and file stat attributes. On subsequent crawls, when a directory mtime is the same as in the cache, the directory list and all file stat attributes can be retrieved from the cache rather than over the network mount. |
