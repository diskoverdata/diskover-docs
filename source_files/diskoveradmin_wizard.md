### Access DiskoverAdmin

The DiskoverAdmin service enables fine-tuning of settings for Elasticsearch, Diskover-Web, and worker services, which were previously set up within PHP files on the server. This update simplifies configuration and maintenance, eliminating the need for a Linux sysadmin to manage your Diskover environment.

You have reached THE big moment. Paste this link in a browser to access DiskoverAdmin and complete the configuration process for all Diskover's components and plugins.
