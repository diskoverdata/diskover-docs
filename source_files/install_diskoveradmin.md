## DiskoverAdmin Installation

### Overview

Diskover-Web is nothing without its new Administrator! The DiskoverAdmin configuration management user interface will allow you to further configure your Diskover system once it’s up and running.

⚠️ &nbsp;Note that DiskoverAdmin must be installed on the same host as Diskover-Web.

### Start Here

During this process, you will need the latest [Diskover 2.3x zip archive](https://download.diskoverdata.com/). Note that this is subject to change to RPMs in the near future. Once you have the zip file, you can `SCP` it to the machine that is designated for DiskoverAdmin. 

🔴 &nbsp;**On-prem** | Will scp the file to the root user's home directory:
```
scp <path to diskover.zip> root@ipAddress:~/
```

🔴 &nbsp;**AWS** | Will scp the file to the user's home directory. Example using Rocky:
```
scp -i <path to PEM file> <path to diskover.zip> rocky@bastion-IP:~/
```

⚠️ &nbsp;Note that the user will differ depending on your OS. It is best to consult your AWS EC2 Console to get the exact user to connect to the bastion. Generally, these are the users for the following OS:

| OS | User |
| --- | --- |
| Rocky Linux | rocky |
| Centos 7 or 8 | centos |
| RHEL or Amazon Linux | ec2-user |

### Python Installation

Python should already be installed as instructed in the [Diskover Scanners/Workers Installation](#install_scanners) section. Alternatively, you could use a [PyEnv (Python Environments)](#pyenv).

⚠️ &nbsp;Note that some steps here, such as symlinking to the main Python3 executable, might not be advisable if this system is used for other Python-based programs.

### DiskoverAdmin Installation

🔴 &nbsp;Extract your zip archive:
```
unzip diskover-2.3.0.zip
```

🔴 &nbsp;Copy the diskover-admin folder:
```
cd diskover-2.3.0/
cp -a diskover-admin /var/www/
```

🔴 &nbsp;Adjust the file ownership:
```
chown -R nginx.nginx /var/www/diskover-admin/
```

🔴 &nbsp;PIP installs:
```
cd /var/www/diskover-admin/etc/
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

🔴 &nbsp;NGINX configuration - Copy the location block output of this cat command:
```
cat /var/www/diskover-admin/etc/diskover-web.conf
```

🔴 &nbsp;Paste the contents here. This needs to be in its own location block:
```
vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/diskover-web.conf
```

🔴 &nbsp;Set NGINX proxy params:
```
cp /var/www/diskover-admin/etc/proxy_params /etc/nginx/
```

🔴 &nbsp;Restart and check services health:
```
systemctl restart nginx php-fpm; systemctl status nginx php-fpm
```

### Daemons 

Now that DsikoverAdmin is installed and configured, let’s daemonize this service with **systemd**.

🔴 &nbsp;Copy default service file:
```
cp /var/www/diskover-admin/etc/diskover-admin.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

🔴 &nbsp;Start the Diskover-Admin service:
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable diskover-admin
systemctl start diskover-admin
systemctl status diskover-admin
```

⚠️ &nbsp;A happy status looks like this:
```
      Starting Uvicorn instance to serve /diskover-admin...
      INFO:     Uvicorn running on unix socket /var/www/diskover-admin/run/diskover-admin.sock (Press CTRL+C to quit)
      INFO:     Started parent process [10559]
      Started Uvicorn instance to serve /diskover-admin. 
```
