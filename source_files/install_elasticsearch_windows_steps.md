You can also use **curl** in a Windows command prompt and make a **GET** request to the Elasticsearch cluster to check if the service is running on your local server.

>_Note:_ **curl** must first be downloaded and installed on your Windows machine before you use it to make HTTP requests.

🔴 &nbsp;Open a command prompt as administrator:
```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/"
```
