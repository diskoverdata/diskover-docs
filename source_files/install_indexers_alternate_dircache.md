The Directory Cache alternate scanner can be used to speed up subsequent crawls when indexing slower network mounted storage.

DirCache alternate scanner uses the Diskover cache module **diskover_cache**, which uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database to store a local cache of directory mtimes (modified times), directory file lists, and file stat attributes.

On subsequent crawls, when a directory mtime is the same as in cache, the directory list and all file stat attributes can be retrieved from the cache rather than over the network mount.

>_Note:_ When a file gets modified in a directory, the directory's mtime does not get updated. Because of this, when using **dircache**, the file stat attributes for each file in the directory retrieved from cache may not be the same as on the storage.

>_Note:_ The first crawl for each top path can take longer as the cache is being built. Each top path has its own cache db file stored in **\_\_dircache\_\_/** directory.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;To use the **dircache** alternate scanner, first copy the default/sample config:

```
mkdir ~/.config/diskover_scandir_dircache
cd /opt/diskover/configs_sample/diskover_scandir_dircache
cp config.yaml ~/.config/diskover_scandir_dircache
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;`load_db_mem` setting can be set to **True** to load the SQLite db into memory when crawl starts. This can sometimes help to improve db performance. Depending on disk speed and amount of RAM for disk cache, this may not help performance or even decrease performance. **It is recommended to leave this set to False.**

>_Warning!_ Setting this to **True** can cause the SQLite db file to occasionally become corrupt (see below). Keeping this setting at the default **False** is advised as it usually does not provide much performance improvement. If you do enable this, check db file size before loading into memory to ensure you don't run out of memory on the indexing host.


ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Scan and index using **dircache** using an auto-index name:

```
cd /opt/diskover
python3 diskover.py --altscanner scandir_dircache /toppath
```

#### Corrupt SQLite Database

If you see this traceback error when starting a scan, the SQLite database has become corrupt. This can happen if previous scans got interrupted abruptly, did not close, and write out the database successfully to disk.

```
sqlite3.DatabaseError: file is encrypted or is not a database
```

If you see this error message, you need to delete the SQLite database file. Refer to the scan log lines (example below) to find the DB file to delete.
