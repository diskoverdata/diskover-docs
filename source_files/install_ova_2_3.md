## OVA Installation

This section contains instructions to quickly get up and running with Diskover using an OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) on **VMWare Workstation** and **VirtualBox**. These OVAs can easily be imported into either of these hypervisors and booted up to run Diskover. This guide provides light instructions on how to import the OVA properly and get it booted up.

### Features
- Diskover and built-in dependencies (Elasticsearch, Python, etc.).
- Diskover is configured to start at boot.
- Hostname set to `diskover`
- DHCP enabled
- CentOS 9.x

### Understand the Network

Understand the networking architecture of the site you will be deploying into. If the site has DHCP already configured,
the virtual machine will acquire an IP address from the offered range. Ensure the offered IP address will route to the
clients using the service. The file systems to be scanned must also be reachable from the offered DHCP range.

For clients to access the service, they will need to route to the hostname provided in the license file. The hostname
in the license file must match the hostname on the Linux host. It is recommended that DNS be used to resolve the
service.

### Performance Limitations

ðŸŸ¨ There are performance limitations when running Diskover using an OVA, as it will start to get sluggish at around **200 million files**.

### VirtualBox Import and VM Settings

ðŸ”´ Import the OVA by choosing **File -> Import Appliance**

ðŸ”´ Choose **Source -> Local File System**

ðŸ”´ Then **File : -> Browse for the OVA on your local machine and import it here**

ðŸ”´ Once imported, choose **Next**

ðŸ”´ By default, the OVA sets the **CPU=2** and **RAM=2GB**. You need to adjust these settings according to your host machine. The recommended specs for OVA usage for POC: 

- **CPU=12**
- **RAM=64GB**

ðŸ”´ Once you've adjusted the settings choose **Start**

### VMWare Workstation Import and VM Settings

ðŸ”´ To import the OVA by choosing **File -> Open**

ðŸ”´ Give the VM a unique name, ex:**diskover-2.3.0**

ðŸ”´ Once you've given the VM a name, choose **Import**

ðŸ”´ By default, the OVA sets the **CPU=2** and **RAM=2GB**. You need to adjust these settings according to your host machine. The recommended specs for OVA usage for POC: 

- **CPU=12**
- **RAM=64GB**

ðŸ”´ Once you've adjusted the settings choose **Power on this virtual machine**

### Diskover Configuration

Now that we have the OVA imported into our hypervisor we have a bit of configuration to do here to get the system up and running and ready to scan.
These instructions will be the same regardless of which hypervisor you imported the OVA into.

 (OVA Login)
- You will see two user accounts 'Vagrant' and 'Diskover'
- Choose to login as the 'Diskover' user
-- Password 'darkdata'
  (Open Activies)
- Click on 'Activities' in the top left

-- Additionally, open Google Chrome or Firefox
  (Diskover Configuration Wizard)
  2.3.0 has an easy configuration wizard that we will walk through here
- In the browser window go to : http://localhost:8000/diskover_admin/config/
  (Diskover Configuration Wizard - ElasticSearch)
- In the initial section here you will see 'hosts-0' and within the box you will see 'elasticsearch', replace this with 'localhost'
-- Choose 'Test' in the bottom right
    * This should show your ES cluster health with a status of 'green' at the top of the window. 
- Choose 'Save & Continue'
- Choose 'Yes'
-- Choose 'Test' in the bottom right
    * This should show your ES cluster health with a status of 'green' at the top of the window. 
- Choose 'Save & Continue'
  (Diskover Configuration Wizard - License)
- Choose SKIP in the bottom right for the License Configuration, we will do this at the end..
  (Diskover Configuration Wizard - Time Settings)
- Select your proper timezone
- Choose 'Save & Continue'
- Check the box for 'Show Times in Local Timezone'
- Choose 'Save & Continue'
  (Diskover Configuration Wizard - RabbitMQ)
-- Choose 'Test' in the bottom right
    * This should show 'Connection Successful' at the top of the screen


### License Request and Installation 

Now that we have the Diskover system configured, follow the instructions to [request your license](#hd_id) and [its installation](#license_location).


### Diskover Configuration Enhancements



### Size the Instance

Before you begin, ensure there are sufficient memory and disk resources for the OVA:

- Memory 32GB RAM
- Disk:
    - Media & Entertainment workflows: 256GB fast disk/SSD
    - Life Science, EDA, etc. workflows: 512GB fast disk/SSD
<br>
ðŸ”´ To Expand the root partition and filesystem:

```
sudo -s
yum install cloud-utils-growpart-0.27-10.el7.x86_64
```

ðŸ”´ To grow the sda3 partition:

```
growpart /dev/sda 3
```

ðŸ”´ To grow the root filesystem:

```
xfs_growfs -d /
```

### OVA Installation Instructions

ðŸ”´  To obtain the Diskover OVA software:

1. If you are new to the **Diskover Download Portal**, you will fist need to [create an account](https://download.diskoverdata.com/register.php).
2. Once your account is approved, you'll receive a confirmation email.
3. You can then login at [https://download.diskoverdata.com/](https://download.diskoverdata.com/) and download the latest OVA file.

ðŸ”´  Linux Login:

User: **diskover**

Password: **darkdata**

ðŸ”´  You can elevate yourself via:
```
sudo -s
```

ðŸ”´  Diskover Login:

User: **admin**

Password: **darkdata**

ðŸ”´ Request a license by sending us your **hardware ID** as described below, so we can generate a license. 

- First, you can click on the **Diskover Install Tools** icon on the desktop to open the **Diskover License Tools** application.

![Image: Centos Desktop](images/ova_install_desktop.png)

- Select **Register license** in the drop-down list located at the upper right corner, and then click on **Get hardware ID and installed version** to get your hardware ID number. This will trigger an automated [email to Diskover](mailto:licenses@diskoverdata.com) with your license request.

![Image: Diskover License Tools](images/ova_install_diskover_licensing_tool.png)

ðŸ”´  Install your license files as explained in the [software activation chapter](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_installation_guide_ova/#software_activation).

ðŸ”´  You will need to mount the file system(s) of interest to the virtual machine and then start indexing. You can create a [scheduled index task by following these instructions](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_configuration_and_administration_guide/#managing-diskover-tasks-via-the-task-panel).

ðŸ”´  Or you can manually initiate an index:

- To run the Diskover indexing process from a shell prompt:
```
cd /opt/diskover
```
- Start your first crawl:
```
python3 diskover.py -i diskover-<indexname> <storage_top_dir>
```
