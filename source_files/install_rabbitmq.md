## RabbitMQ and Amazon MQ Server Installation
___

### Overview

RabbitMQ or Amazon MQ serves as the messaging bus/queue system that communicates with all Celery systems on your Diskover Worker nodes. We recommend installing this service on a dedicated standalone host.

Once all components are installed, you will be able to [configure your messaging environment](). We strongly recommend following the deployment order outlined in this guide.

### RabbitMQ for Linux

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Configure yum repositories:
```
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/script.rpm.sh | bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/rabbitmq/erlang/script.rpm.sh | bash
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Install **rabbitmq-server** and **erlang**. Note that installing these packages may require different steps depending on the Linux distribution:
```
yum -y install rabbitmq-server erlang
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Ensure the service starts and enable it):
```
systemctl start rabbitmq-server.service
systemctl status rabbitmq-server.service
systemctl enable rabbitmq-server.service
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Configure RabbitMQ for use with Diskover:
```
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
rabbitmqctl change_password guest darkdata                  (This will password not be used.  It is only to secure the guest account)
rabbitmqctl add_user diskover darkdata                      (Feel free to chose your own user / pass)
rabbitmqctl set_user_tags diskover administrator            (If you changed users, set it properly here and replace 'diskover')
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / diskover ".*" ".*" ".*"    (If you changed users, set it properly here and replace 'diskover')
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Restart the service:
```
systemctl restart rabbitmq-server
systemctl status rabbitmq-server
```

ðŸŸ¨ &nbsp;This completes the RabbitMQ configuration for Diskover. You should now be able to access the RabbitMQ Management Portal:
```
http://$rabbitMQHost:15672/#/
```
