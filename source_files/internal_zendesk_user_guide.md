![Image: Zendesk Manual Ticket Creation](images/zendesk_internal_guide_support_add_options.png)

🔴 &nbsp;Fill out all the fields with as much information as possible. An **asterisk** denotes a required field. 

🔴 &nbsp;Before clicking on **Submit as New**, you can apply a different status than **New** to the ticket if applicable using the arrow beside the button.

### Manage Customer Profiles (User)

🔶&nbsp;Depending on your Zendesk account access, you will be able to view, create, and/or modify user profiles.

🔴 &nbsp;You shouldn't have to do much of that, as users need to create an account before they can submit a ticket:

🔶&nbsp;Depending on your Zendesk account access, you will be able to view, create, and/or modify company profiles.

🔴 &nbsp;You shouldn't have to do much of that as most accounts have been pre-populated or are created automatically when a new user creates an account. But in case you do need to manually add a customer/domain:

<p id="article_formatting"></p>

![Image: Zendesk Articles Formatting](images/zendesk_internal_guide_guide_article_formatting.png)

| OPTION | DESCRIPTION |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 | Click on the pencil to edit the **title** of the article and make sure it's very descriptive and easy to understand the purpose of the article |
| 2 | Plain text is easy to do but if you want to **write codes** see # 5 and 6 below.<br><br>🔶 &nbsp;Zendesk doesn't understand Markdown formatting, but is HTML friendly |
| 3 | Text formatting tools:<ul><li>There are no formal guidelines to follow, for now anyway:</li><li>We recommend you look at other articles and follow the same/similar formatting.</li><li>Make sure that articles are nice and easy to read.</li><li>Share your formatting ideas with the team!</li></ul> |
| 4 | This will open the body of the text in **source code format**, which you may need to do sometimes, especially for code formatting. Zendesk sometimes wants to include too much or too little of the codes. This way you'll have perfect control, see # 5 and #6. |
| 5 | Unfortunately, Zendesk doesn't offer a copy icon for codes like we have in our GitHub docs, but users can click once in a code block which will select all the text automatically, then they can just copy the whole code content.<ul><li>You should be able to click the **code block** option in the formatting menu and that should create a code block.</li><li>If you can't get this to work the way you want, open the source code format as per #4 and use the following:<br><br>**``<pre><code id="codeSnippet">first line of code``<br>``second line of code``<br>``third line of code</code></pre>``**<br><br>This is what the results will be:<br><img src="images/zendesk_internal_guide_guide_code_block.png" width="800"></li></ul> |
| 6 | If you want to show only part of a sentence as codes:<ul><li>Open the source code format as per #4</li><li>Use the following:<br><br> This is an example of how to **``<code>insert code here</code>``** in a sentence.<br><br>This is what the results will be:<br><img src="images/zendesk_internal_guide_guide_code_block_in_sentence.png" width="500"></li></ul> |
| 7 | As of July 2024, there is only the **Administrators** category of **Management Permissions** so there is nothing to edit here for now, but you can check it out anyway by clicking on the forward arrow |
| 8 | You can't create a new article without filling out this section, and it's always a good idea to review if you're editing an article, go to [**Article Placement**](#article_placement) for more information | 
| 9 | Save, save, save!<ul><li>This will save your modifications if you're editing an existing article</li><li>If you are creating a new article, this will save a draft only, see #11 if you are ready to publish</li></ul> | 
| 10 | Click the **View** button to see how your article will look for end users. When you are done and want to go back to the admin view click **Guide admin**:<br>![Image: Zendesk Create a Category](images/zendesk_internal_guide_guide_go_to_admin_view.png) |
