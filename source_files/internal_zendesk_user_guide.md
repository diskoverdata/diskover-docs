We‚Äôll break this section down into each of the important units and discuss how we utilize them.

Agents
The bread and butter of Zendesk, all of the users in the system who have access to client tickets are Agents. Our Zendesk costs are based on a flat usage fee + how many Agent seats are we using. More Agents means more hands to work tickets and view the tickets as intended in Zendesk, currently we utilize a few generic accounts in the system to increase people‚Äôs ability to see more things, as we grow as an organization and company we may want to give more individual seats to directly offboard work or to increase that ‚Äúpersonal touch‚Äù.

Admins
Elevated Agent accounts. There is no cost distinction or client visible difference between these accounts and standard Agent accounts, being an Admin user allows the Agent access to the Admin tab. Currently most of our Agents are also Admin users, as we continue to grow this is likely to be reduced and phased out as with a more defined process and hierarchy comes more restrictions and regulations to govern the increased structure. As a note, only one account is deemed the ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù of Zendesk and that is the only account with the necessary permissions to increase total headcount and adjust any billing, Admins can create other Agent accounts provided the headcount is available to allot.

End Users
Basic accounts required to create/view support tickets. These accounts are free and can be created by anyone - specifically configured this way as we are a support organization so anyone who knows where to contact us in turn can contact us. End Users are defined by their email address and we use that to filter and assign them to specific organizations. Agents/Admins do not need to create individual accounts for End-Users they will be created automatically as users interact with the Portal, however at the beginning of a project or client onboarding we may create these as a step in the process for our major points of contact and ensure they are assigned to the org as it‚Äôs made.

When navigating the system and interacting with End-User accounts there are some very helpful components to know, and for that we‚Äôll use a fan-favorite: Lody!!
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b200db9b-8852-4381-b200-873693001fc5)

Requester: Who put in the ticket, this can be edited by the agent or filled in manually and allow someone to submit a ticket on behalf of someone. As much as possible we want to limit the number of tickets Requested by Levels Beyond (that aren‚Äôt internal tickets) so it is encouraged that if the ticket is about a client it should come from the client so it‚Äôs associated with their org.

Assignee: Group and Agent the ticket is assigned to, Zendesk is permissioned around this to a degree so the Partner managed group can only see what is assigned to their Group.
CCs: This one is pretty self explanatory, we add CCs here just like in email, the one call out is we sometimes see a user sending an internal message, sometimes this can be fixed by adding them here as a CC, other times Zendesk routes emails funny as if the user is using a service outside of their standard email.

Sharing: We don‚Äôt use this and I just haven;t gone hunting to see if I can remove it.

Tags: These don‚Äôt need to be interacted with and form naturally as you answer the different fields, you can dive into this with the Tag option to see the Tag Cloud it creates. The only time we add to this is when submitting a Feature Request, make sure that tag is included and it goes straight to the Product Board.


Resolution Code: The intent of this option is for the Agent to categorize what the issue was so when we look at reporting we can group issues together and see where we spend the majority of our time - we want this to be specific, but not too specific and ideally we don‚Äôt want to update it frequently as it would add new metrics into the reporting. The other note is we set this up with nested options so we could split Implementation and Support answers, there is overlap in the responses as a result but still shows which team is doing what.

Priority: This field correlates directly with our SLAs and the timers setup in the system around them. The more we leverage this field and work to identify the priority level when a ticket comes in the more we can balance the workload and ensure we hit our contractually obligated metrics. This will be covered more in depth in the ‚ÄòSLAs‚Äô section.

Environment/Application: Same concept as Resolution Code here, what component of our application does this issue affect, it‚Äôs a multi-picklist field so encourage adding whatever makes sense. This field should be kept up to date as we expand and look to add more micro services and distributed systems so we can pinpoint what components we see the most ticket activity around.

Impact: This field is aimed at End-Users and is meant to help gather a sense of how severe the issue is to the client. Since this field is only available to End-Users who use the Zendesk app it‚Äôs frequently left blank on submission and is not required from an Agent standpoint.
Expected Behaviour: Targeted at End-Users to try and gather: ‚ÄúHow is it supposed to work?‚Äù Since this field is only available to End-Users who use the Zendesk app it‚Äôs frequently left blank on submission and is not required from an Agent standpoint.

Observed Behaviour: Targeted at End-Users to try and gather: ‚ÄúWhat is it actually doing?‚Äù Since this field is only available to End-Users who use the Zendesk app it‚Äôs frequently left blank on submission and is not required from an Agent standpoint.

Steps to Reproduce the Issue: Targeted at End-Users to try and gather: ‚ÄúHow do we make it do the thing?‚Äù Since this field is only available to End-Users who use the Zendesk app it‚Äôs frequently left blank on submission and is not required from an Agent standpoint.

Environmental Changes: Targeted at End-Users to try and gather any potential changes around the system that may be impacting or causing this issue. Since this field is only available to End-Users who use the Zendesk app it‚Äôs frequently left blank on submission and is not required from an Agent standpoint.

Azure Bug Case: At the time of setting this up there was no good integration for Zendesk to Azure like we used to use in Jira to help us connect the two when we had bugs to report. We use this field to help gather the bug URL or number so we can easily reference back to it, it‚Äôs marked as required for Agents so we don‚Äôt forget when closing a ticket - annoying when there‚Äôs no bug but great when there is and you forgot to snag the ticket number.

Level of Effort: This field was designed to give us an idea of complexity and how difficult certain tasks are. Since we don‚Äôt do Tier 1-4 and re-assign tickets as they get bumped up the chain this was our best way of tracking complexity. I don‚Äôt frequently track metrics across this field and it‚Äôs probably the easiest thing to remove from tickets at this stage.

Hours: Similar to LoE, I wanted a rough idea of how many hours we spent on tickets mostly as a tool to help us when doing time entry. This was implemented well before I started to use Zendesk Explore and at this point could easily be deprecated in favor of tracking overall time to completion of a ticket.

Premium Support: This check box is set by a trigger, using our SLA metrics if a Premium client sends in a ticket this box auto checks so the Agent immediately knows it‚Äôs a Premium Client. In the grand scheme of things it was my plan to use this field to automate after hours responses to non-premium clients but doing this also comes with some drawbacks (namely client experience) and every time i‚Äôve mentioned it we aren‚Äôt quite there yet.

Does documentation exist for this issue: This field is the newest addition and was part of our ongoing documentation efforts the goal behind it being to pull a report of tickets where ‚Äúneeds to be documented‚Äù is checked so we can create new tasks based around what has come up recently in tickets.
