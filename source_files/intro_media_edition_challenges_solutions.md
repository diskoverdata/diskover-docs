## Media Specific Challenges and Solutions

This section describes the prominent challenges that most Media and Entertainment facilities are currently facing.

### Lack of Files Visibility

The lack of visibility and access to files' location and metadata is a real problem for end-users in media facilities, mostly due to the protected production network, as security is paramount because of piracy concerns and possible leaks to the public prior to release dates.

|There is a difficult to non-existing balance between allowing people to do their jobs while keeping the appropriate level of security around clients’ files. | Diskover gives read-only access to the files’ metadata and attributes, therefore, safeguarding your valuable assets while allowing employees to efficiently find the files they need. |
|Difficulty finding disorganized assets from different sources (ex: intra and inter companies systems).|Diskover scans all fragmented data living across heterogenous repositories and brings all the information in one global index.|
|Users need to be notified when files are available and where they are located. | Diskover offers extraordinary speed and reliability with  [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)  in the backend continuously indexing all storage volumes in parallel for instant findability. |
|Too many search results due to the inability to refine searches.|Diskover includes many search tools and filters, as well as granular searches on media-specific attributes (ex: resolution, codec, duration, etc.)|
|Unable to verify if the file found/needed is the right one.  | Diskover's media info plugin enriches the ability to locate the correct file. Future thumbnail/preview plugin functionality will further increase accuracy. |


### Inefficient Workflows

Tremendous person-hours wasted due to a lack of continuity and automation around file-based production lines.

| CHALLENGES | SOLUTIONS |
|--|--|
|Need to track orders through the production process, from order creation to invoicing and delivery.  | Diskover order management and scheduling plugins reduce or eliminate manual correlations and provide automation and scaling capabilities. One example of such is the Xytech Order Status Plugin. |
|The order system is usually not an integral part of the storage infrastructure, affecting the ability to charge accurately for storage per specific project. | The cost analysis tool within Diskover provides the ability to associate a storage element to the cost of goods sold to a project, client, work order, etc. |
|The inability to identify files that need to be managed at the source. | Diskover’s manual tagging and automated scheduled tasks insure safe and methodical file management, as well as file findability. |

### Fast Pace Environments

Significant increase in order volume compounded with shorter deadlines.

| CHALLENGES | SOLUTIONS |
|--|--|
|Manual orders are prone to errors and don’t scale with today’s high volume. | Diskover’s global view and accuracy combined with order management and scheduling plugins allow for reduced human-prone errors associated with manual processes, as well as increased automation and scalability of production processes associated with file-based workflows. |
