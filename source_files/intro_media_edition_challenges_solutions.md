## Media Specific Challenges and Solutions
___
This section describes the prominent challenges that most Media and Entertainment facilities are currently facing.

### Lack of Files Visibility

The lack of visibility and access to files' location and metadata is a real problem for end-users in media facilities, mostly due to the protected production network, as security is paramount because of piracy concerns and possible leaks to the public prior to release dates.

|There is a difficult to non-existing balance between allowing people to do their jobs while keeping the appropriate level of security around clients’ file. | Diskover gives read-only access to the files’ metadata and attributes therefore safeguarding your valuable assets while allowing employees to efficiently find the files they need. |
|Difficulty finding disorganized assets from different sources (ex: intra and inter companies’ systems).|Diskover scans all fragmented data living across heterogenous repositories and brings all the information in one global index.|
|Users need to be notified when files are available and where they are located. | Diskover offers extraordinary speed and reliability with  [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)  in the backend continuously indexing all storage volumes in parallel for instant findability. |
|Too many search results due to the inability to refine searches.|Diskover includes many search tools and filters, as well as granular search on media specific attributes (ex: resolution, codec, duration, etc.)|
|Unable to verify if the file found/needed is the right one.  | Diskover's media info plugin enriches the ability to locate the correct file. Future thumbnail/preview plugin functionality will further increase accuracy. |


### Inefficient Workflows

Tremendous person-hours wasted due to a lack of continuity and automation around file-based production line.

| CHALLENGES | SOLUTIONS |
|--|--|
|Need to track orders through the production process, from order creation to invoicing and delivery.  | Diskover order management and scheduling plugins reduce or eliminate manual correlations and provide automation and scaling capabilities. One example of such is the Xytech Order Status Plugin. |
|Order system is usually not an integral part of the storage infrastructure, affecting the ability to charge accurately for storage per specific project. | The cost analysis tool within Diskover provides the ability to associate a storage element to the cost of goods sold to a project, client, work order, etc. |
|The inability to identify files that need to be managed at the source. | Diskover’s manual tagging and automated scheduled tasks insure for safe and methodical file management, as well as file findability. |

### Fast Pace Environments

Significant increase of order volume compounded with shorter deadlines.

| CHALLENGES | SOLUTIONS |
|--|--|
|Manual orders are prone to errors and don’t scale with today’s high volume. | Diskover’s global view and accuracy combined with order management and scheduling plugins allow for reduced human prone errors associated with manual processes, as well as increased automation and scalability of production processes associated with file-based workflows. |
