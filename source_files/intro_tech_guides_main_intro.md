An unparalleled data management solution, Diskover consolidates in a global index unstructured data spread across heterogeneous repositories. Cutting-edge analytical tools and automated tasks, combined with uniquely fast search capabilities empower all levels of an organization to have their own relationship with data, resulting in informed decision making, lower operating costs, along with enhanced workflows and their monetization.

The Diskover curation platform addresses the growing complexity associated with managing unstructured data in a hybrid environment. While the unstructured data management problem has been around for some time, the complexity is skyrocketing due to recent developments. The move to the cloud accelerated over the last year due to COVID-19, remote workers, and the overall view that cloud is more viable these days. Large organizations have now adopted and leveraged hybrid cloud models.

Since unstructured data management is even more critical and complicated than ever before, there is a significant increase and interest in solutions that address the growing complexity of data fragmentation, across both physical data storage and cloud repositories.

Diskover embraced the logical approach of being open-source, as well as integrating other open-source platforms like Elasticsearch and Kibana, as open platforms are more powerful and highly integrative, wide-spread, mature, developed around transparency and trust, and help organizations become more agile and collaborative in their data innovation.

The scale out platform supports comprehensive search, data analysis, tagging, and scheduled tasks capabilities to enhance data management, enable automation in file-based workflows, and therefore improve the efficiency of the organization and its people, in addition to reducing storage cost.

>_Note:_  Amazon OpenSearch Service is the name AWS has given to its successor to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service. Most OpenSearch Service operating and configuration information should also apply to Elasticsearch.
