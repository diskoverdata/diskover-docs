### Diskover Use Cases

Diskover addresses the organization and integration of unstructured data stored across a variety of storage repositories from Linux  and Windows  filesystems to S3 based storage. Inefficient data management often results in:

- Difficulty relating unstructured data to business objectives (adding value or decreasing risk).
- Reduced findability of files.
- Decreased production and inefficient workflow problems.
- Scalability of people and processes with incredibly high rate of data growth.
- Significant increase in man-hours.
- Increase of data storage costs.

Data curation  often involves annotation, publication, and presentation of the data such that the value of the data is maintained over time, and the data remains available for reuse and preservation. Data curation encompasses the manual and automated processes needed for principled and controlled data creation, maintenance, and management, together with the capacity to add value to data. The rapid growth of unstructured data has required a transition of traditional human curation tasks to more automated and scalable processes. Furthermore, the curation process often involves many “data stakeholders” in the process, each with different use cases. Diskover addresses the use cases of the various data stakeholders.
