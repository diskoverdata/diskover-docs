### Overview
Diskover Data is a web-based platform that provides single-pane viewing of distributed digital assets. It provides point-in-time snapshot indexes of data fragmented across cloud and on-premise storage spread across an entire organization. Users can quickly and easily search across company files. Diskover is a data management application for your digital filing cabinet, providing powerful granular search capabilities, analytics, file-based workflow automation, and ultimately enables companies to scale their business and be more efficient at reducing their operating costs. 

Although Diskover is intuitive and easy to use by any user, its installation and configuration must be accomplished by a System Administrator or someone with equivalent expertise.
