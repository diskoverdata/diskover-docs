### AWS Elasticsearch Domain

Routine maintenance of the AWS Elasticsearch environment consists of two components: 1) managing indices, and 2) upgrading Elasticsearch versions as they become available.

#### Managing Indices

Refer to the [Elasticsearch Index Management](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_configuration_and_administration_guide/#elasticsearch-index-management) page for managing your AWS Elasticsearch/OpenSearch indices.

#### Upgrading Elasticsearch Versions

AWS recommends upgrading to the latest Elasticsearch versions as they become available on Amazon Elasticsearch Service. Information on upgrading your AWS Elasticsearch cluster can be found here:
