### AWS Elasticsearch Domain

Routine maintenance of the AWS Elasticsearch environment consists of two components: 1) managing indices, and 2) upgrading Elasticsearch versions as they become available.

#### Upgrading Elasticsearch Versions

AWS recommends upgrading to the latest Elasticsearch versions as they become available on Amazon Elasticsearch Service. Information on upgrading your AWS Elasticsearch cluster can be found here:
