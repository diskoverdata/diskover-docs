## Path Translation
___

The path translation feature is designed to support heterogenous client environments like Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The path for each client to access or locate a file or directory will vary depending on client operation system. For example, Windows operating systems use the backslash slash `\` and Linux operating systems use a forward `/`. Path translation provides the capability to translate paths within Diskover to appropriate the clientâ€™s operating system. The following describes two mechanisms for translating paths within Diskover.

### Translating Paths Stored in Elasticsearch Index

To translate paths that get stored within the Elasticsearch document, for example removing **/mnt** from a path like **/mnt/isilon1**

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Open a terminal session:
```
vi /root/.config/diskover/config.yaml
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Set **replace:** to **True**

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Configure desired **from:** and **to:**

### Path Translation in Diskover-Web for Copy/Paste

To set client profiles that get translated when a user copies a path within the Diskover-Web user interface. 

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;For example, to translate from `/isilon1/data/dm/tools/staging files.xls` to `\\isilon1\data\dm\tools\staging files.xls`
```
vi /var/www/diskover-web/src/diskover/Constants.php
```
