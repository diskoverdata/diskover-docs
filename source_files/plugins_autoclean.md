### Autoclean Plugin

The autoclean plugin is designed to move, delete, or rename based on a set of highly configurable criteria. Any Elasticsearch query (tags, age, size, path, filename, etc.) can be used for the criteria providing very granular actions.

With the use of tags, the autoclean plugin can be used to implement a RACI model or approval process for archive and deletion (approved_archive, approved_delete, etc.) tag application. The plugin criteria can then be set to meet desired set of tags (times, etc.) to invoke action.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;The autoclean plugin runs post as scheduled job operating on completed indices, to enable:
```
vim /root/.config/diskover_autoclean/config.yaml
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Configure desired rules:
- Query can be any valid Elasticsearch query.
- Action can be: delete, rename, or move.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Create custom task in Task Panel to run on scheduled basis.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Set the following:
- Run Command Args: **python3**
- Post Command: **/opt/diskover/diskover-autoclean.py -V -l /mnt/snfs2**

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Change **/mnt/snfs2** to the desired **top_level_path**, for example, if the desired volume to index is **isilon**, then the path would be **/mnt/isilon**
