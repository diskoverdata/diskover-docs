The BAM info harvest plugin is designed to provide BAM metadata attributes about a file without granting the Diskover user any read/write file system access.
The BAM info plugin enables additional metadata for the SAM and BAM file formats to be harvested at time of index. 

The specification for the SAM file format can be found here:

[https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)

The BAM info plugin uses the Python **pysam** to harvest attributes about the BAM and SAM files:

New indices will use the plugin and any SAM or BAM file will get additional info added to the Elasticsearch indexâ€™s **bam_info** field.

The attributes provide the ability to view storage and file system content from a workflow perspective, for example, all the frame rates on any given storage.

You can view and search on BAM info attributes in Diskover-Web since it will store it in a new field for video files, the field name is **bam_info**.











The media info harvest plugin is designed to provide media metadata attributes about a file without granting the Diskover user any read/write file system access.

The media info plugin enables additional metadata for video files to be harvested at time of index. The media info plugin uses **ffmpeg/ffprobe** to harvest attributes about the media file.

New indices will use the plugin and any video file will get additional media info added to the Elasticsearch indexâ€™s **media_info** field.

The attributes provide the ability to view storage and file system content from a workflow perspective, for example all the frame rates on any given storage.

You can view and search on media info attributes in Diskover-Web since it will store it in a new field for video files, the field name is **media_info**.

>_Note:_  The media info plugin is not supported for S3 based object storage.

The alternate configuration file must be invoked when indexing S3 based volumes.
