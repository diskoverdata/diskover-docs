```
sudo systemctl restart cineviewer
```

#### Command Line Process Management

Linux with systemctl.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;To get application status:

```
systemctrl status cineviewer
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;To restart the application:

```
systemctrl restart cineviewer
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;To stop the application:

```
systemctrl stop cineviewer
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;To see logs in while the app is running:

```
journalctl --lines 0 --follow _SYSTEMD_UNIT=cineviewer.service
```

#### Configuration

Cineviewer has two configuration files to control the app. The first is the app defualt configuration, usually `/opt/cinesys/cineveiwer/app/configure-default.json` which contains all the default values for the app.

The other configuration file, usually `/opt/cinesys/cineveiwer/configure.json` contains the changes specific to the installation.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;A `configure.json` only needs to assign values that are different from the defaults. For example the configure file to change the port used:

```
{ 
    "app": { 
        "port": "3001"
    }
}
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;A quick overview of some of the settings:

| transcode | test |
| cineplay | test |

**transcode** > for switching out transcoders ffmpeg
**cineplay** > for controlling the cache location
**toast** > for adding file mounts and access

#### User Configuration | Login Credentials

By default Cineviewer is not login protected. To enable basic logins a users config setting can be added. Note the app can also make use of the Active Directory module to enable logins at larger facilities.

```
"users": {
    "users": [
         { "name":"admin", "groups":["admin"], "pass":"******" },
         { "name":"guest", "groups":["staff"], "pass":"******" }
    ]
}
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Once the user config settings are added, users will be prompted to enter their login credentials.

#### Transcoding Settings

By default, Cineviewer uses `ffmpeg` to do most transcoding. The paths can se modified to `ffprobe` using the transcode settings:

```
"transcode": {
    "ffmpeg":"./bin/ffmpeg/ffmpeg",
    "ffprobe":"./bin/ffmpeg/ffprobe"
}
```

#### Diskover Module Settings

The Diskover module option has multiple settings. The most important is the `diskover_url`.

```
"diskover": {
    "login": false, 
    "strict": true,
    "path": "/var/www/diskover-web",
    "sessdir": "/var/lib/php/session",
    "self_url": "https://diskover-demo.cinesys.io/cineplayer/",
    "diskover_url": "https://diskover-demo.cinesys.io/",
    "search_url": "https://diskover-demo.cinesys.io/searchjson.php",
    "login_page": "https://diskover-demo.cinesys.io/login.php"
}
```

#### Player Cache

```
"cineplay": {
    "cache": "./cache",
    "cache_expire": "120"
}
```

#### File Mounts

```
"toast": {
    "sortable": ["dpx", "exr"],
    "find_max_files": "2048",
    "mounts": [
    {
        "type":"fs",
        "prefix":"Diskover:",
        "name":"Diskover",
        "path": "/"
    }
   ]
}
```

#### Modes of Operation

Cineviewer has basically two modes of operation, the **file browser** and the **viewer**.

##### Using the File Browser

One of Cineviewer's biggest strengths is its file system abstraction layer called **Toast**. Toast allows the app to treat files on the local filesystem the same as files on S3 or even in an asset management system such as Portal or Iconik. Toast directories are configured via the `toast.mounts` configuration.
