## Diskover-Web Plugins - File Actions
___

Diskover-web is designed for extensibility. The open-source architecture is designed to promote extensibility via web plugins known as File Actions.

File Actions are located in the `public/fileactions` directory.

File Actions are written in PHP and have the extension `.php`. Diskover-web includes a few example file actions with the extension `.php.sample`. The extension will need to be renamed to `.php` in order to use them.

To learn more about using and configuring web plugins, see File Actions in the [dev guide](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_dev_guide/#diskover-web-plugins-file-actions).
