CineViewer is a video playback and management system designed for video and broadcast professionals. It is designed to securely view high-resolution media from a remote browser, without giving users access to the source files, as well as play content that may not be supported by standard web browsers, including file formats such as ProRes and MXF. Additionally, Cineviewer allows users to play back image sequences in formats such as DPX and EXR. The player can be launched in one click from the AJA Diskover Media Edition user interface, allowing for seamless validation of media assets, therefore increasing productivity, while safeguarding your production network.

With its timecode-accurate playback and seeking capabilities, CineViewer enables users to navigate through content with precision. The system also supports up to 16 channels of audio, providing a variety of audio configuration options to accommodate different projects. Furthermore, Cineviewer includes closed captioning functionality, ensuring an accessible experience for all users.

The following sections will guide you through the installation and configuration of CineViewer, helping you utilize this tool effectively for your video and broadcast needs.

🔴 &nbsp;CineViewer should reload the page and be operational.

#### Command Line Key Management

You can also edit the license file directly. 

🔴 &nbsp;Locate the keyfile at the install directory, by default:

```
/opt/cinesys/cineviewer/license.dat
```

🔴 &nbsp;Edit the file using `nano` or `vi…` after saving the file, you may need to restart Cinevieiwer using the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart cineviewer
```

#### Command Line Process Management

Linux with systemctl.

🔴 &nbsp;To get application status:

```
systemctrl status cineviewer
```

🔴 &nbsp;To restart the application:

```
systemctrl restart cineviewer
```

🔴 &nbsp;To stop the application:

```
systemctrl stop cineviewer
```

🔴 &nbsp;To see logs in while the app is running:

```
journalctl --lines 0 --follow _SYSTEMD_UNIT=cineviewer.service
```

#### Configuration

CineViewer has two configuration files to control the app. The first is the app default configuration, usually `/opt/cinesys/cineveiwer/app/configure-default.json` which contains all the default values for the app.

The other configuration file, usually `/opt/cinesys/cineveiwer/configure.json` contains the changes specific to the installation.

🔴 &nbsp;A `configure.json` only needs to assign values that are different from the defaults. For example, the configure file to change the port used:

```
{ 
    "app": { 
        "port": "3001"
    }
}
```

🔴 &nbsp;A quick overview of some of the settings:

| SETTING | PURPOSE |
| --- | --- |
| **transcode** | For switching out transcoders ffmpeg or ffprobe |
| **cineplay** | For controlling the cache location |
| **toast** | For adding file mounts and access |

#### User Configuration | Login Credentials

By default, CineViewer is not login protected. To enable basic logins a users' config setting can be added. Note the app can also make use of the Active Directory module to enable logins at larger facilities.

```
"users": {
    "users": [
         { "name":"admin", "groups":["admin"], "pass":"******" },
         { "name":"guest", "groups":["staff"], "pass":"******" }
    ]
}
```

🔴 &nbsp;Once the user config settings are added, users will be prompted to enter their login credentials.

#### Transcoding Settings

🔴 &nbsp;By default, Cineviewer uses `ffmpeg` to do most transcoding. The paths can se modified to `ffprobe` using the transcode settings:

```
"transcode": {
    "ffmpeg":"./bin/ffmpeg/ffmpeg",
    "ffprobe":"./bin/ffmpeg/ffprobe"
}
```

#### Player Cache

```
"cineplay": {
    "cache": "./cache",
    "cache_expire": "120"
},
```

#### File Mounts

```
"toast": {
    "sortable": ["dpx", "exr"],
    "find_max_files": "2048",
    "mounts": [
    {
        "type":"fs",
        "prefix":"Diskover:",
        "name":"Diskover",
        "path": "/"
    }
   ]
}
```

#### Modes of Operation

Cineviewer has basically two modes of operation, the **file browser** and the **viewer**.

##### Using the File Browser

One of Cineviewer's biggest strengths is its file system abstraction layer called **Toast**. Toast allows the app to treat files on the local file system the same as files on S3 or even in an asset management system such as Portal or Iconik. Toast directories are configured via the `toast.mounts` configuration.

<img src="images/image_file_action_cineviewer_file_browser.png" width="750">

##### Configuring Different Types of File System

All file system mounts have 3 common fields:

| FIELD | PURPOSE |
| --- | --- |
| **type** | File system type |
| **prefix** | Prefix shown on the Path |
| **name** | Name shown on the navigation button |

##### File System Mounts

To make files on a standard operating system available use the **FS mount**. The FS mount uses the field **path** to point toward the desired directory.

```
"toast": {
    "mounts": [
    {
        "type":"fs",
        "prefix":"Production:",
        "name":"Production",
        "path": "/mnt/production"
    },
    {
        "type":"fs",
        "prefix":"Records:",
        "name":"Record",
        "path": "/mnt/records"
    },
 }
```

##### AWS S3 Mounts

```
    {
         "type":"s3",
         "prefix":"S3:",
         "name":"cinesys-io-s3",
         "path": "cinesys-io-s3",
         "bucket": "cinesys-io",
         "path": "support",
         "region": "us-east-1",
         "key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
         "secret": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    },
   ]
}
```

#### Navigating and Finding Content

- You can click on a directory to change to that directory.
- Clicking on a media file will open the viewer. 
- You can sort the current directory by clicking on the headers above the file list, clicking twice will reverse the order. 
- On the right side, there is a **Search** field where you can search from the current directory. 
- To go back up a directory you can click the **Up Directory** button in the file list or click on the **Path** text in the upper left corner of the app.

One great feature of Cineviewer is that when you move through directories or view content, the browser URL updates to link to that directory or content. This way simply copying the URL allows you to share a particular directory, video, or even a single frame of content.

#### Diskover Module for CineViewer

The Diskover File Action Plugin Module for Cineviewer allows you to open files or directories seamlessly from the Diskover user interface. Inside Cineviewer the user can also take advantage of Diskover high-speed indexed search.

##### Installing CineViewer Plugin for Diskover

This plugin adds **open in CineViewer** to the **File Action** menu in Diskover.

🔴 &nbsp;Copy `cineviewer.php` to the `/var/www/diskover-web/public/fileactions` directory

```
<div style='overflow:wrap;'>
<pre style='overflow:wrap;'>
     sudo cp /opt/cinesys/cineviewer/app/modules/diskover/diskover_install/cineviewer.php /var/www/diskover-web/public/fileactions
     sudo chown nginx  /var/www/diskover-web/public/fileactions/cineviewer.php
</pre>
</div>
```

🔴 &nbsp;Depending on your web setup you may need to edit `cineviewer.php` and adjust the following line:

```
    $cineviewer_host = "http://" + $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] + ":3000";
```

🔴 &nbsp;Edit the Diskover `Constants.php` file and add a file action:

```
    sudo vi /var/www/diskover-web/src/diskover/Constants.php
```

🔴 &nbsp;Add **File Actions**:

```
       const FILE_ACTIONS = [
        'open in CineViewer' => [
            'webpage' => 'cineviewer.php',
            'allowed_users' => [Constants::ADMIN_USER, Constants::USER],
            'allowed_ldap_groups' => ['diskover-admins', 'diskover-powerusers', 'diskover-users'],
            'menu_icon_class' => 'far fa-file-image'
           ]
       ];
```

🔴 &nbsp;Test the installation by finding a file in Diskover and using the **open in CineViewer** under the **File Action** menu.

##### Diskover Module Settings

The Diskover module option has multiple settings. The most important is the `diskover_url`.

```
"diskover": {
        "login":   false,
        "strict":   true,
        "path":    "/var/www/diskover-web",
        "sessdir": "/var/lib/php/session",
        "self_url": "https://diskover-demo.cinesys.io/cineplayer/",
        "diskover_url": "https://diskover-demo.cinesys.io/",
        "search_url": "https://diskover-demo.cinesys.io/searchjson.php",
        "login_page":   "https://diskover-demo.cinesys.io/login.php"
}
```

#####  Installing the Diskover Search Feature for CineViewer

This config change for CineViewer will allow you to search Diskover from Cineviewer. 

🔴 &nbsp;Edit your CineViewer configuration file `/opt/cinesys/cineviewer/configure.json` and make sure there is a setting for `diskover_url` that points
to your local `diskover`:

```
    sudo vi /opt/cinesys/cineviewer/configure.json

    "diskover": {
        "diskover_url": "http://127.0.0.1/"
    }
```

##### Searching Diskover Within CineViewer
