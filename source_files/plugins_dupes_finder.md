### Duplicates Plugin

The Diskover duplicate plugin (dupes-finder) leverages post processing of index to check for duplicates, across all file systems, or subset thereof. The plugin supports **xxhash** or **MD5 checksums**. The plugin is designed for two use cases:

1. To check for duplicates across a single or all file systems.
1. To check for duplicates among a selected set of directories.

Calculating file **hash checksums** is an expensive CPU/disk operation. The dupes-finder provides configuration options to control what files in the index get a hash calculated. In addition, the dupes-finder provides additional optimization mechanisms:

- The diskover-cache **sqlite3 db** is used to store file hashes.
- An existing index can be used to lookup file hashes.

The dupes-finder can also be used to add file hashes to all the files in the index, not just the duplicates found.

The duplicates plugin will store hash values that can be stored only for duplicates or for all files.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;The dupes-finder plugin runs post index and  operates on completed indices as a scheduled job or on  demand job to provide  duplicates analysis on completed indices, to enable:
```
vim /root/.config/diskover_dupesfinder/config.yaml
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;At minimum configure the following:
- mode: desired checksum **xxhash** or **md5**
- extensions: desired file extensions to check, for all files use `[ ]`

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;To run the duplicates check via command line:
```
cd /opt/diskover
python3 diskover_dupesfinder.py â€“useindex=indexname
```
