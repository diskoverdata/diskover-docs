The index differential plugin is designed to provide a list of file differences between two indices (or points in time). The differential list can be used to feed synchronization tools (i.e. rsync) or identify deltas where two repositories should be identical. Outputs a CSV file containting the diffs between the two indices.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;The index differential plugin runs post index and operates on completed indices as a scheduled job or on demand job to provide differences between two indices.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Copy default/sample config:

```
mkdir /root/.config/diskover_indexdiff
cd /opt/diskover
cp configs_sample/diskover_indexdiff/config.yaml /root/.config/diskover_indexdiff/
vim /root/.config/diskover_indexdiff/config.yaml
```
