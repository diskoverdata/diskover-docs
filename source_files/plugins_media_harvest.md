### Media Info Harvest Plugin

The media info harvest plugin is designed to provide media metadata attributes about a file without granting the Diskover user any read/write file system access.

The media info plugin enables additional metadata for video files to be harvested at time of index. The media info plugin uses **ffmpeg/ffprobe** to harvest attributes about the media file.

New indices will use the plugin and any video file will get additional media info added to the Elasticsearch indexâ€™s **media_info** field.

The attributes provide the ability to view storage and file system content from a workflow perspective, for example all the frame rates on any given storage.

You can view and search on media info attributes in Diskover-Web since it will store it in a new field for video files, the field name is **media_info**.
