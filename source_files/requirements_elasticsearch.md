### Elasticsearch Requirements

#### Elasticsearch Version

Diskover is currently tested and deployed with Elasticsearch v8.x. Note that ES7 Python packages are required to connect to Elasticsearch v8 cluster.

#### Elasticsearch Architecture Overview and Terminology

Please refer to this diagram to better understand the terminology used by Elasticsearch and throughout the Diskover documentation.

#### Elasticsearch Cluster

- The foundation of the Diskover platform consists of a series of Elasticsearch indexes, which are created and stored within the Elasticsearch endpoint. 
- An important configuration for Elasticsearch is that you will want to [set Java heap mem size](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.16/advanced-configuration.html#set-jvm-heap-size) - it should be half your Elasticsearch host ram up to 32 GB.
- For more detailed Elasticsearch guidelines, please refer to [AWS sizing guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/sizing-domains.html).
- For more information on [resilience in small clusters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/high-availability-cluster-small-clusters.html).

#### Requirements for POC and Deployment

| | Proof of Concept | Production Deployment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nodes | 1 node | 3 nodes for performance and redundancy are recommended |
| CPU | 8 to 32 cores | 8 to 32 cores |
| RAM | 8 to 16 GB (8 GB reserved to Elasticsearch memory heap) | 64 GB per node (16 GB reserved to Elasticsearch memory heap |
| DISK | 250 to 500 GB of SSD storage per node (see Elasticsearch Storage Requirements below) | 500 to 1 TB of SSD storage per node (see Elasticsearch Storage Requirements below) |

#### AWS Sizing Resource Requirements

Please consult the [Diskover AWS Customer Deployment Guide](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_aws_deployment_guide/) for all details.

| | AWS Elasticsearch Domain | AWS EC2 Web-Server | AWS Indexers |
| ---| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum | i3.large | t3.small | t3.large |
| Recommended | i3.xlarge | t3.medium | t3.xlarge |

#### Indices

##### Rule of Thumb for Shard Size

- Try to keep shard size between 10 â€“ 50 GB
- Ideal shard size approximately 20 â€“ 40 GB

Once you have a reference for your index size, you can decide to shard if applicable. To check the size of your indices, from the user interface go to > **gear icon** > **Indices**:

##### Examples

- An index that is 60 GB in size: you will want to set shards to 3 and replicas* to 1 or 2 and spread across 3 ES nodes.
- An index that is 5 GB in size: you will want to set shards to 1 and replicas* to 1 or 2 and be on 1 ES node or spread across 3 ES nodes (recommended).

ðŸŸ¨ &nbsp; Replicas help with search performance, redundancy and provide fault tolerance. When you change shard/replica numbers, you have to delete the index and re-index.

#### Estimating Elasticsearch Storage Requirements

##### Individual Index Size

- 1 GB for every 5 million files/folders
- 20 GB for every 100 million files/folders

ðŸŸ¨ &nbsp; The size of the files is not relevant.

##### Replicas/Shard Sizes

Replicas increase the size requirements by the number of replicas. For example, a 20 GB index with 2 replicas will require a total storage capacity of 60 GB since a copy of the index (all docs) is on other Elasticsearch nodes. Multiple shards do not increase the index size, as the index's docs are spread across the ES cluster nodes.

ðŸŸ¨ &nbsp; The number of docs per share is limited to 2 billion, which is a hard Lucene limit.

##### Rolling Indices

- Each Diskover scan results in the creation of a new Elasticsearch index.
- Multiple indexes can be maintained to keep the history of storage indices.
- Elasticsearch overall storage requirements will depend on history index requirements.
- For rolling indices, you can multiply the amount of data generated for a storage index by the number of indices desired for retention period. For example, if you generate 2 GB for a day for a given storage index, and you want to keep 30 days of indices, 60 GB of storage is required to maintain a total of 30 indices.
