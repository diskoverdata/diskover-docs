### Diskover Resource Requirements

The following section outlines the reference architecture for resources required for the Diskover curation platform. Two of the Diskover deployment components, Elasticsearch and Web server, can be hosted on-premise or in the cloud, and the third component, Diskover indexer is typically deployed using the customerâ€™s on-premise resources.

It is recommended to separate the Elasticsearch, web-server and indexing host(s). Indices ideally should be on SSD. NFS data stores do not usually perform well for indices.
