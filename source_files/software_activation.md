### Licensing Overview

The [**Diskover Community Edition**](https://diskoverdata.com/solutions/) doesn't require a license key and can be used for an unlimited time. 

The **Diskover paid [Editions/Subscriptions](https://diskoverdata.com/solutions/) require a license. Unless otherwise agreed:
- A trial license is valid for 30 days and is issued for 1 Elasticsearch node.
- A paid subscription license is valid for 1 year. Clients will be contacted about 90 days prior to their license expiration with a renewal proposal.

Please reach out to your designated Diskover contact person or [contact us](mailto:info@diskoverdata.com) directly for more information.
