### Licensing Overview

The [**Diskover Community Edition**](https://diskoverdata.com/solutions/) doesn't require a license key and can be used for an unlimited time. 

The [**Diskover Editions/paid subscriptions**](https://diskoverdata.com/solutions/) require a license. Unless otherwise agreed:
- A trial license is usually valid for 30 days and is issued for 1 Elasticsearch node.
- A paid subscription license is valid for 1 year. Clients will be contacted about 90 days before their license expiration with a renewal proposal.

Please reach out to your designated Diskover contact person or [contact us](mailto:licenses@diskoverdata.com) directly for more information.

### Hardware ID Generation

Your hardware ID should have been automatically generated when going through the [Initial Configuration]() section. The following command is listed in case you need to manually generate your hardware ID. Please [send that unique identifier along with your license request](mailto:licenses@diskoverdata.com) as needed.

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Become the root user:
```
sudo -i
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;To manually create your hardware ID:
```
cd /opt/diskover
python3 diskover_lic.py -g
```

After installing Diskover and completing the basic configuration, you will need to generate a hardware ID. Please [send that unique identifier along with your license request](mailto:info@diskoverdata.com).

ðŸŸ¨ &nbsp;**IMPORTANT!**

- Check that you have configured your Elasticsearch host correctly, as it is part of the hardware ID encoding process.
- Note that if your [Elasticsearch cluster]((https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_installation_guide/#elasticsearch-requirements)) ID changes, you will need new license keys.
