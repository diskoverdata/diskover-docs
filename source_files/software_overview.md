### You Can't Break Anything!

As an end-user, you can’t break anything. You can't personally edit, move, or delete the files that you see in the user interface, because Diskover only contains an index of the metadata of the files, not the files themselves. So don’t be shy to click around.

### Features Overview

- Integrated **SEARCHES** > global searches using built-in tools, manual queries, or a combination of both.

### Access to Features

Even though several features will be added over time, Diskover will mostly remain a search and read-only tool for the end-users; data integrity and protection being the ultimate objective.

Diskover allows all end-users to have access to the data via a global index  in a read-only format, for them to make informed decisions, and then in turn for the System Administrators to curate the data in a secure and controlled environment.

Your System Administrator creates all [login](#login) accounts. Depending on your data relation needs within your scope of work, your account level will be as an end-user or an admin, the latter allowing for additional editing access (reports, etc.). While working with Diskover as an end-user, you might come across the icon below, indicating that you need to communicate any requests with someone with an admin level account.

### Use Cases

Diskover offers numerous search tools, reports, and other manual, as well as automated functions, to fulfill the needs of all stakeholders and different business verticals.

Let’s use the example of the Media and Entertainment environment. With theatrical workflows, there is the need to protect content from piracy; facilities often build two completely independent networks 1) where users have access to the internet, and 2) a production network with no internet access and strict controls on personnel that have access to this network. However, in production workflows, Customer Service Representatives, Producers, and Operations often need to search the production network. Diskover provides visibility to search for content, without providing access to the actual content.
