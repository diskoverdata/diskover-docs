### You Can't Break Anything

As an end-user, you can‚Äôt break anything. You can't personally edit, move, or delete the files that you see in the user interface because Diskover only contains an index of the metadata of the files, not the files themselves. So don‚Äôt be shy to click around.

- **ANALYTICS**: Several pre-established and customizable reports allowing for informed decision-making.

- **ACTIONS**: Limitless possibilities through plugins, for example, seamless integration with third-party platforms, automated actions, in-house plugins to automate your own specific in-house workflows, etc.

### Consumers of Data

Diskover allows all stakeholders within an organization to have their own specific relationship with data. Here is an example of a line of business users, their needs, and challenges:

### Access to Features

Even though some plugins may allow users some actionable power over the data (ex, data movement), Diskover will mostly remain a search and read-only tool, data integrity and protection being the ultimate objective.

DisKover allows all end-users to have access to the data via a global index in a read-only format for them to make informed decisions and then, in turn, for the System Administrators to curate the data in a secure and controlled environment.

Your System Administrator creates all [login](#login) accounts. Depending on your role, your account level will be as an end-user or an admin, the latter allowing for additional editing access (reports, etc.). While working with Diskover as an end-user, you might come across the icon below, indicating that you need to communicate any requests with someone with an admin-level account.
