## Software Update Installation

When subscribing to a paid [Diskover Solution](https://www.diskoverdata.com/solutions/), all software updates, bug fixes, patches and version upgrades are included during the licensed period. Diskover will send an email notification to its customer base which will contain all necessary information.

Please refer to the `CHANGELOG.MD` files (for both Diskover and Diskover-web) in the tar.gz/zip download to see what has changed and any breaking changes. The software may fail to work after upgrading without referring to these files for important changes. Changelogs can also be viewed [here](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_changelogs/).

After updating Diskover-web, it is recommended to [force/hard refresh](https://fabricdigital.co.nz/blog/how-to-hard-refresh-your-browser-and-clear-cache) your web browser to get the latest files from the web server and clear your local browser cache.
