One of the powerful features of Diskover is the ability to add “business context” to the index of files. Business context enables:

- Increased findability and searchability based on one or more combination of fields, for example, name and tag value.
- More informed and accurate data curation decisions.
- Ability to build an approval process (or RACI model) for data curation decisions.
- Reporting aligned to business purpose change reports from “disk language” of size, age, extension, etc. to “business language” of projects, clients, status, etc.
