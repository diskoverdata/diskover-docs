## Indices
___

#### Unable to select indices

- Make sure the box [Always use latest indices](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#index_selection) is unselected.

#### Need more frequent scans of indices

- Your System Administrator may need to schedule scans of one or more of your volumes on a more frequent basis, please address the matter with your technical department.

#### Waiting for files to be indexed

- If you know that some files were onboarded to a directory but are not yet indexed by Diskover, you can have a live view of the directory(ies) via [File Action > list dir](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#file_action_list_dir) and pro-actively search/copy paths.

#### Scanning/indexing takes a long time

- The storage volume may have a very large amount of data and although Diskover is extremely quick and powerful, it can still require some time. 
- Some storage types are much faster to scan than others, for example new technology versus old.
- There might also be an obscure reason in the backend for that issue and it should be addressed with your System Administrator.
