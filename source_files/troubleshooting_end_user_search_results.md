> Please refer to the [Manual Search Syntax chapter in the Diskover User Guide](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#manual-search-syntax) and/or the [Quick Reference Card](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/images/quick_reference_card_diskover_generic.png) for detailed information on searches. 

#### Directories and/or files seems to be missing in search results

- Expand your search with [* which acts as a wild card](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#wild-card_1).
- If using [operators (and, not, or)](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#operators), make sure you are using them correctly and [grouping](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#the-need-of-grouping-criteria-for-complex-queries) them if needed.
- If searching on a specific [field name](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#queries-with-field-names), make sure that both field name and variable are used and typed correclty.
- Make sure you don't have saved [Filters](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#search-filters) limiting your results.
- Make sure [Current Dir](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#current_dir) is deselected in order for Diskover to search all your storage volumes and directories.
- Make sure you don't have specific [index/indices](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#indices) selected.
- Try to refresh your volumes with **Reload Indices** > click the **gear icon** in the top right corner of the user interface > Select **Reload Indices**

#### There are too many items found in the search results

- An overuse of the [* wild card](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#wild-card_1) could be the cause.
- [Use Predictive Search](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#use-predictive-search) in your Settings may be selected, therefore always applying the * for any searches and expanding your results.
- If using [operators (and, not, or)](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#operators), revisit them to make sure they are used and [grouped](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#the-need-of-grouping-criteria-for-complex-queries) appropriately.
- Try searching on specific [field name(s)](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#queries-with-field-names).
- Using [Filters](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#search-filters) might help pinpoint your results.
- Using [Current Dir](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#current_dir) might help focus your results to a specific path.

#### Empty directory(ies) in the search results

To avoid having empty directories in your search results, open the search [Filters](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#search-filters) and type **1** in the **File size (min)** field, click **Save filters** and resume your search.
