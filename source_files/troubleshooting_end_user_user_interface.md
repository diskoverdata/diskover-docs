## User Interface


#### I lost my settings

- Diskover [settings are saved as cookies](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#settings-overview) in your browser:
  - If you switch to a different browser, you will need to reselect your settings.
  - Your settings may reset after a software upgrade or if you manually used [**Clear Diskover cookies**](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#clear-diskover-cookies) in your settings.

#### The user interface is frozen with a spiraling wheel

- The **ESC key or browser back button** usually won't work to exit this state.  
- Instead, try clicking on **any icons in the top menu** of the Diskover user interface—this often breaks the wait cycle.

#### The user interface is acting or looking abnormal

1. If this happens after a **software update**, first try refreshing your volumes:  
   - ⛭ → **Reload Indices**  

2. If the issue persists, try the following steps in order:  

   - **Hard refresh your browser**  
     - **Windows**: `CTRL + F5`  
     - **Mac**: `CMD + SHIFT + R`  
   - **Clear the [cache]**(https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#clear-diskover-cache)  
   - **Clear your [cookies]**(https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#clear-diskover-cookies) *(Note: This will reset your settings, and you'll need to reconfigure them.)*  
   - **Log out and log back into Diskover.**
