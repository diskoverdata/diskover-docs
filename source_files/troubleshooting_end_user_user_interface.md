## User Interface

#### Customized settings are gone

- The Diskover settings are saved as cookies in your browser:
  - If you use a different browser, you will have to reselect your settings.
  - Your settings might reset after a software upgrade or if you used **Clear Diskover cookies** in your settings.

#### User interface is frozen with sparaling wheel

- You usually can’t use ESC or the back page arrow from your browser, but you can click on any icons in the top menu in the Diskover user interface to break that wait cycle.

#### User interface is acting/looking abnormal

1. This might happen, especially after a software update, so first try refresh your volumes with **Reload Indices** > click the **gear icon** in the top right corner of the user interface > Select **Reload Indices**.

2. As a last resort, try one of the following in this order: 

  - Hard reload/refresh your browser (Windows > CTRL + F5, Mac > CMD + SHIFT + R)
  - Clear the [cache](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#clear-diskover-cache)
  - Clear your [cookies](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#clear-diskover-cookies) – you will need to reselect your options if you had previously customized your [settings](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#settings).
  - Log out and log back in the Diskover application.
