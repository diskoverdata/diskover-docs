### Diskover-Web Task Management

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;To get started with the task panel, check that you have the json files in diskover-web `public/tasks/` directory.
```
cd /var/www/diskover-web/public/tasks
ls *.json
tasklog.json	tasks.json	templates.json	workers.json
```

You should see the above `.json` files which are used by the Task Panel for storing task and worker related data. 

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;If you only see `.json.sample` files, copy the sample/default files:
```
for f in *.json.sample; do cp $f "${f%.*}"; done
chmod 660 *.json
chown nginx:nginx *.json
```

- You will need to start at least one Diskover worker daemon `diskoverd` to work on tasks. 
- `diskoverd` can run on the diskover host or on any host. 
- `diskoverd` requires access to the Diskover-Web REST API which is located at `http://<diskover-web-host>:<port>/api.php`

### Hard Reload After a Software Update

Sometimes when the Web user interface gets updated, it requires a forced/hard reload of the browser, in order to reload the new Javascript, etc. cached files.

[Click here for more information](https://fabricdigital.co.nz/blog/how-to-hard-refresh-your-browser-and-clear-cache).

For example, this overlay display of the volumes and directories might happen after a software update and a hard reload might be necessary:

### Missing Indicies

By default diskover-web does not load all indices in Elasticsearch. This is for performance reasons in case there are thousands of indices in ES.

On the indices page, there is a `max indices to load` input setting which controls the number of indices to load. Indices are loaded in order by creation date. If you are missing indices in the list, try increasing this number. This is a per user setting that gets stored in a cookie in each user's browser.

This number can also be set for all users in web config's `MAX_INDEX` setting. If the user's browser `maxindex` cookie is lower than this number, there cookie will be set to this number.
