#### Log Warnings

`urllib3.connectionpool - WARNING - Connection pool is full, discarding connection: localhost`

If you are seeing this Elasticsearch warning, there are two things you can try. 

- In your diskover config, lower the `maxthreads` to be something like 16 or 20.
- Set your `maxsize` setting to be higher for Elasticsearch connections to 40 or more.
