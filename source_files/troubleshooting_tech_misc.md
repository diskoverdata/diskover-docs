#### Config Error

If you get an error message when starting `diskover.py` like **Config ERROR: diskover.excludes.dirs not found**:

- Make sure that you used spaces and not tabs.
- Check the config for errors or missing settings from default config.
- Check that your config file is not missing any lines from `default/sample` config.
- Check that there are no errors in your config like missing values.
