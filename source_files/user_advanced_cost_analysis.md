<h3 id="cost_analysis">Cost Analysis Report</h3>

The cost analysis report offers a snapshot of where your storage money is being allocated. This tool is designed to control your operating costs  by:

- Charging your customers appropriately for storage.
- Incentivize cleanup/data curation instead of purchasing more storage.

<h4 id="cost_config">Storage Cost Calculation and Configuration Overview</h4>

The initial setup is enabled and configured by a System Administrator using your organizationâ€™s real figures. Here is an example of how the cost is calculated:

>Storage cost is $100/TB x client's project is using 10 TB = cost for that client's project is $1,000

There are many other factors that can be compounded to the cost of the storage itself, for example:

- Electricity.
- Square footage of building space for physical units.
- Support contract.
- System Administratorâ€™s salary.
- Diskoverâ€™s annual subscription cost.

>ðŸ”† Different storage volumes can have different costs associated to them.

You need an admin account to edit the customizable cost analysis reports.
