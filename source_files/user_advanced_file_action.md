This feauture allows you to run a real-time scan of a directory, lists the content so you can search and pro-actively copy paths. This feature only works for on-premise storage at the moment and is not avaiable for cloud storage.

The typical use case is when you are not finding a file/directory in the indexed volumes within Diskover, you can access live directories and see if the files you are waiting to be onboarded will be available during the next indexing, as well as pro-actively copy paths for a work order.

- Select one or multiple directories in the results pane.
- Click the **File Action** icon.
- Select **list dir**.

>ðŸ”† &nbsp;If you want to **list dir** a single directory, you don't have to select it first; you can use the **gear icon** in the results pane by the directory name. 

This image is an example of what could be seen following **list dir** selection:

- This will give you a list of the file/directories in the live directory which will be indexed during the next scheduled task.
- You can search using CTRL F for Windows or COMMAND F for Mac.
- This view allows you to copy paths if needed, although you can only copy them one by one if they are random and not in a block.
