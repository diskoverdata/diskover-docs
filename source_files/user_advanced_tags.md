Tags are additional metadata assigned to an item, they are used to add business context or data curation actions to be taken (ex: archive, delete, keep, clean). Tagging is crucial for smooth workflows and proper curation of data.

This section will talk about manual tagging, but Diskover can also be configured to schedule automated tasks to apply autotags, usually based on aging or service agreements, etc., in order to safely and methodically curate data in the backend.

>ðŸ”† &nbsp;A file or directory can have multiple tags.

#### Tags Removal

##### Removing a Single Tag

1. In the results pane, select the item(s) you wish to remove the tag from.
2. Click the **Tag** drop-down list and select the same tag that is already applied to it > trying to reapply the same tag will remove it.

2. Click the **Tag** drop-down list.
3. Click on **Apply tags to** and make a selection - [get more info on recursive and non-recursive](#apply_tags_to) - this single action will remove the tag(s) to all the sub-directories and/or files so they have the same tags as the main directory.
