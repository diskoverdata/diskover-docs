Tags are additional metadata assigned to an item, they are used to add business context or data curation actions to be taken (ex: archive, delete, keep, clean). Tagging is crucial for smooth workflows and proper [curation of data](#data_curation).

This section covers manual tagging, but Diskover can also be configured to schedule automated tasks to apply [autotags](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_configuration_and_administration_guide/#tagging-additional-business-context-metadata), usually based on aging,  service agreements, etc., in order to safely and methodically curate data in the backend.

>ðŸ”† &nbsp;A file or directory can have multiple tags.

#### Tags Overview

![Image: Manual Tag Selection](images/image_tags_manual_application.png)

A) **Tag** drop-down list: To add or remove tags, will not open until you select at least one item in the [results pane](#results_pane).

B) **Select** file(s) and/or directory(ies) to be tagged: You first need to select one or several items to add or remove a tag.

C) **Tags column**: To see tags  associated with a file or directory, go in your [settings](#hide_columns) to unhide that column if it's not visible.

D) **Tag selection**: List of tags that are available, you need an admin account to [edit that list](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_configuration_and_administration_guide/#tags-display-and-editor-within-diskover-web-user-interface).

E) **Remove all tags**: Select from column B) the items you wish to remove the associated tags first and then select E) > **WARNING!** you cannot undo this action.

F) **Add new tag**: To quickly add a single new tag in the drop-down list - an admin account is required to [add/edit tags](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_configuration_and_administration_guide/#tags-display-and-editor-within-diskover-web-user-interface).

<p id="apply_tags_to"></p>

G) **Apply tags to**: Choices of applying tags [non-recursively or recursively](#recursive) - can only be achieved from a directory and that directory needs to have a tag assigned to it prior in order to assign the same tag(s) recursively or non-recursively.

  - **All results (all pages)**: Will apply tags to all your current search results, no matter if they are files or directories, and no matter how many pages of results, but will not apply tags recursively.

  - **Selected Folders - [Non-recursive](#recursive)**: Will apply tags exclusively to the path/directory you are pointing to.

  - **Selected Folders - [Recursive](#recursive)**: Will apply tags to the path/directory, as well as all sub-directories and files, inside that path.

#### Search on Tags

You can quickly search on tags using the [filters](#filters) tool or using a manual query in the search bar.

##### Searching tags with [Filters](#filters):

Whether you are drilling down or running manual queries, adding tags rules to your filters will filter in OR out all items depending on the filters you apply.

1. Click on the  **[Filters](#filters)**  icon at the top of the interface.
3. Go to the  **Tags** section.
4. Select  **is**  or  **is not**.

6. Click  **Save filters**  at the bottom of the window.

##### Searching tags via manual queries:

  ![Image: Manual Search for Tags](images/image_tags_report_access_from_search_bar.png)

  - You can also use [**operators**](#operators) to search on more than one tag at a time, ex: **#archive and #delete**, **(#archive or #delete)**
  - You can use the [**field name**](#search_field_names) to search on tags, ex: **tags:delete**, note that this query is case sensitive, **tags** needs to be lower case and the **tag** needs to be typed exactly as listed in the tags drop-down list.

#### Tags Report

The tags built-in report gives a visual snapshot of all tagged items in all your storage volumes. Note that the colors have no particular meaning in this report.
