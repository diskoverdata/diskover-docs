Tags are additional metadata attached to files or directories, providing business context and triggering data curation actions like archiving or deletion. Tagging is essential for streamlined workflows and effective [data curation](#data_curation).

This section covers **manual tagging**. Your System Administrator can configure and schedule automated tags, known as [AutoTags](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_setup_and_config_guide/#tags), and those are usually for data hygiene, lifecycle management, etc., to safely and methodically curate data in the backend.
