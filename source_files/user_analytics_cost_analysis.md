The cost analysis report offers a snapshot of where your storage money is being allocated. This tool is designed to control your operating costs  by:

- Charging your customers appropriately for storage.
- Incentivize cleanup/data curation instead of purchasing more storage.

#### Storage Cost Calculation and Configuration Overview

The initial setup is enabled and configured by a System Administrator using your organizationâ€™s real figures. Here is an example of how the cost is calculated:

>Storage cost is $100/TB x client's project is using 10 TB = cost for that client's project is $1,000

There are many other factors that can be compounded to the cost of the storage itself, for example:

- Electricity.
- Square footage of building space for physical units.
- Support contract.
- System Administratorâ€™s salary.
- Diskoverâ€™s annual subscription cost.

>ðŸ”†  &nbsp;Different storage volumes can have different costs associated with them.

This diagram explains how storage cost is [enabled and configured](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_configuration_and_administration_guide/#storage-cost-reporting) by your System Administrator.

  - **Current dir only**: If applicable, to limit the results to the path you selected in the search page and locked down via [Current Dir](#current_dir) before navigating to Smart Searches.

D) Cost analysis is global, if you want to narrow the results:
