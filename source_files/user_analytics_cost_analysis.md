#### Storage Cost Calculation and Configuration Overview

Storage cost can be set globally or per storage volume, directory, etc. This tool is designed to control operating costs by 1) charging clients accurately for storage of their projects and 2) clean-up/data incentivizing.

This feature is enabled and configured by your System Administrator. The storage costs can either be estimated globally, by storage volume, or down a directory level. The estimations need to be done outside of Diskover. Besides the cost of the storage itself, other factors can be compounded like electricity, service contract, System Administrator‚Äôs salary, subscription fees, etc. The estimations need to be calculated and configured per gigabyte.
