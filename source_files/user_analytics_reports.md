Reports were designed to easily help you find what you don't know; it's like reverse engineering. Fully customizable queries with what matters to your business, therefore for you to be able to quickly pinpoint those hard-to-find files and statistics. These reports are global and accessible to everyone in your organization.

  - **Current dir only**: If applicable, to limit the results to the path you selected in the search page and locked down via [Current Dir](#current_dir) before navigating to Reports.

F) Reports are global, if you want to narrow the results:
  - To a single volume > activate the **Current top path only** filter.
  - To a specific path > activate the **Current dir only** filter as described in E).

G) **Edit reports**: You can view the queries used for the report, but an admin account is required to edit them. If you have a search query that you’d like to add to the list and do not have an admin account, copy the full query/criteria and share it with your System Administrator.
