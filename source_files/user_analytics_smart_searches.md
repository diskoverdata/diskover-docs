### Smart Searches

Fully customizable reports with what is relevant for your business (by customers, projects, clean up, storage tier, etc). Smart searches were designed for repeatable reports; they are basically saved searches. The goal is to avoid having to recreate complex queries when you know you will need the same report regularly. These reports are global and accessible by everyone in your organization.
