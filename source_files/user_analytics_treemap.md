### Treemap

The treemap report visualizes hierarchical data using nested figures—the larger the rectangle, the more data the directory or file contains. This provides a graphical representation of folder sizes.

#### Accessing Treemap

| From the **Analytics** drop-down list | From the <img src="images/icon_more.png" width="25"> located in the path column in the results pane |
