### User Analysis 

The user analysis report provides a snapshot of data utilization by individual users or groups. It helps manage who's using the storage space, as well as operating costs. This report must be enabled and configured by your System Administrator.

However, proper configuration is required to ensure accurate reporting, and access may depend on the permissions set by your System Administrator. |
| B | **Group**: Aligns with the authentication method in use. It relies on user metadata from the configured authentication system (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, or other identity providers) to track data utilization by users or groups. However, proper configuration is required to ensure accurate reporting, and access may depend on the permissions set by your System Administrator.  |

| D | **Allocated**: The actual size that the files are occupying, can be helpful for [charging storage costs accordingly](#cost_analysis). |
| E | **% Allocated**: Owner or group storage space usage divided by the total of all owners or groups. |
| F | **Cost per GB**: Total cost for the space used by an owner or a group, shares the same [storage cost configuration](#cost_config) as the [cost analysis report](#cost_analysis). |
