- Once you've selected the particular path (volumes and/or directory) which you want to use to narrow your searches, activate the **Current Dir** toggle button. 
- Be aware that this selection will remain active until you go back and deactivate the toggle button.

### Others Ways to Limit Your Searches

- You can use the **[filters]**(#filters), top right corner **search path** and select your option from the drop-down list. Remember that filters remain active until you go back and clear them.
- You can **select a specific index** following the instructions in the [indices section](#indices) of this guide. Be aware that this selection will remain active until you go back and reselect **Always use latest indices**.
