### Detailed Attributes/Metadata

The process is slightly different if you want to refer to the attributes of a directory or a file. In both cases, though, a new tab will open with the detailed [metadata](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_metadata_catalog.yml/) configured and harvested for your instance.
