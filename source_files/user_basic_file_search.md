#### Main Features of the Search Page

It is preferable to use the back and forward buttons on your web browser to navigate between pages you have already visited. You can also use the back and forward buttons on the left pane of the file search window, but they are not always responsive depending on which browser you are using.

>ðŸ”† You can [hide/unhide columns](#hide_columns) via your settings.
