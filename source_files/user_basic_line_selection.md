### Line Items Selection

Selecting line items is helpful for multiple reasons, like [exporting results](#export), using [file actions](#file_action), etc.

#### Select or Deselect All

On the [search page](#results_pane), you can select all line items on a page by clicking **Select all** or deselect all line items by clicking  **Unselect All** buttons.
