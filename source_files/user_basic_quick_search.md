### Quick Search

Quick searches will search all your volumes and their directories. They are very intuitive and based on pre-establish smart group of criteria. The drop-down list, and its sub-menus, offer several options. 

Select any criteria and the results will automatically open in the search page. Here is an example:

You can always validate the criteria used for the quick search query in the green info bar, example:
