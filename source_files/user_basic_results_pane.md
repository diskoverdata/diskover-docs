### How to Sort Data in the Results Pane

Sorting is possible within Diskover, but if you have a lot of sorting to do, we recommend that you first [export your data in a csv format](#export) and then open that file in Excel, where you can do elaborate sorting and filtering.

A) **Sort legend**: You can do a primary and secondary sort on any columns, ascending or descending, using the arrows in the headers.
  - **Gray arrows**: unsorted
  - **Blue arrow**: primary sort
  - **Green arrow**: secondary sort

B) **Blue arrow/primary sort**: To reassign the primary sort to any column, just click on the arrow in the column you want to reassign the primary sort.

C) **Green arrow/secondary sort**: To reassign the secondary sort, first click on the current green arrow which will remove it, then click on the arrow in the column you want to reassign the secondary sort.
