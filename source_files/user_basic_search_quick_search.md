### Quick Search

Quick searches will search all your volumes and their directories. The choices are intuitive and based on pre-established smart groups of criteria. The drop-down list, and its sub-menus, offer several options. 

Select any criteria and the results will automatically open in the search page. Here is an example of possibilities:
