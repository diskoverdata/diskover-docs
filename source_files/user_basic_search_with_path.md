### Search with a Path

You can paste a path directly into the search bar to search for files and directories within that path. This is especially useful when a co-worker asks you to investigate a specific location.

⚠️ If you receive a path from a co-worker using a different OS, you may need to [adjust the path](#path_translation) to match your operating system's directory structure before searching.
