### Search with a Path

Although this is not a real built-in tool, it is a cool way to search nonetheless! 

You can paste a path directly into the search bar to search within that location. This is especially useful when a co-worker asks you to investigate a specific path.

⚠️ You may have to [adjust the path](#path_translation) received to adapt the slash direction, for example, to your operating system.
