### Search with a Path

You can paste a path directly into the search bar to search for files and directories within that path. This is especially useful when a co-worker asks you to investigate a specific location.

⚠️ You may have to [adjust the path](#path_translation) received to adapt the slash direction, for example, to your operating system.
