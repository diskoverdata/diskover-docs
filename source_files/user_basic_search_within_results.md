### Search Within Results

This built-in tool is simple, yet very powerful. You can use that search field to refine the results listed on the current page you are viewing.

- It acts similarly as CTRL or CMD + F would, but will only leave the line items for which it finds a match, in addition to giving you the total number of items found.
- The previous line items (from the total items found in the green bar) are only hidden and will reappear as soon as you clear the **Search within results** field.
- You can enter more than one search word and/or numbers as per the above example.
- You can only search with letters or numbers as it will not accept [operators](#operators) or [wild cards](#wildcards).
- You cannot search on [tags](#tags) from this field.
- It will not search other pages if you have more than one page of results, nor will it search [recursively](#recursive).
