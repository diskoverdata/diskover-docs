The options within file actions push the boundaries around read-only files while still safeguarding your source assets. While some plugins are designed for seamless integration with third-party platforms, reducing time and complexity for users along with many other benefits, Diskover also embraces clients deploying their own plugins to automate their specific in-house workflows. 

The [plugins/features needs to be enabled](#https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_configuration_and_administration_guide/#diskover-web-plugins-file-actions) by your System Administrator.

#### [üçø Watch Quick Tips | Indexing and Live View](https://vimeo.com/767272643)

This feauture allows you to view the content of a live directory(ies), lists the content so you can search and pro-actively copy paths. This feature only works for on-premise storage at the moment and is not avaiable for cloud storage.

The typical use case is when you are not finding a file/directory in the indexed volumes within Diskover, you can access live directories and see if the files you are waiting to be onboarded will be available during the next indexing, as well as pro-actively copy paths.

- Select one or multiple directories in the results pane.
- Click the **File Action** icon.
- Select **live view**.

>üîÜ &nbsp;If you want to **live view** a single directory, you don't have to select it first; you can use the **gears icon** in the results pane in line with the directory name. 

The **live view** directory will open in a new tab:

A) Time stamp of when you clicked **live view** in the search page - this time stamp will update if you refresh your browser tab, which will also refresh the data.

B) You can opt to view between 10 to 1,000 line items per page.

C) You can go **Up** one volume at a time - you can also drill down in the results pane.

D) You can hide and unhide columns in the results pane via the **Column visibility** button.

E) You can **Search** for specific words and/or numbers and only the line items containing that value will remain visible - once you remove the characters from that field, the previous line items will come back.

F) You can **Copy** paths:
  - If you want to copy all the paths in the results pane, you don't even have to select anything, just click the **Copy** button.
  - If you want to copy a block of paths, select the first line item, hold the SHIFT key, and click on the last line item.
