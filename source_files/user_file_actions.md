The options within file actions push the boundaries around read-only files while still safeguarding your source assets. Authorized users, following role-based access controls, can initiate File Actions directly from the Diskover interface, supporting a wide range of use cases. Whether it‚Äôs taking targeted actions on data or seamlessly integrating with third-party platforms, Diskover‚Äôs open-source architecture empowers users to develop custom File Action Plugins, enabling the automation of unique in-house workflows with ease and flexibility.
