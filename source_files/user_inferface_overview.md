>üîÜ &nbsp;Diskover should look and act the same on any web browser. The only thing to keep in mind is if you apply some modifications in your [settings](#settings) using Google Chrome for example, they will not transfer to Safari because the [settings](#settings) are tied to the cookies of a browser. In this example, you would need to apply the same [settings](#settings) in Safari.
