<img src="images/login_window.png" width="350">

| STEP | DESCRIPTION |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 | Open a  **Web browser**  of your choice and type the  **URL address**  that was given to you to access Diskover. |
| 2 | Enter your  **Username**  and  **Password**, which were also given to you, probably by your System Administrator. |
| 3 | Click  **Login**. |

‚úèÔ∏è _Diskover should look and act the same on any web browser. The only thing to keep in mind is if you apply some modifications in your [settings](#settings) using Google Chrome, for example, they will not transfer if you switch to Safari because the [settings](#settings) are tied to your browser's cookies._

### User Interface Overview

By default, upon login, you will land on the file search page shown below or the [dashboard](#dashboard) page, depending on how your System Administrator configured your instance. The search page is the most used tool, and this section offers an overview. The subsequent chapters will further explain all other icons, drop-down lists, and features.

üîÜ _Hovering almost anything(buttons, charts, volumes, etc.) in Diskover will give you additional information._

### How to Select a Directory

![Image: How to Select a Directory](images/image_file_search_page_select_directory_20240219.png)

There are several ways to drill down a file tree, here are the main ones:

A) From the **left pane**  below the volumes.

B) From the  **results pane**.

C) From the **path bar**, click any directory to navigate back to that specific directory.

D) Some people like to drill down using the [file tree analytic](#filetree).

>üîÜ &nbsp;Note that the directories in A) the left pane and B) the results pane may differ as the left pane only shows directories with data in them. Empty directories will only be listed in the results pane.
