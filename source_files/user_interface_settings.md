## <a id=“path_translation”></a>Path Translations for Copying Paths

Depending on how your System Administrator configured Diskover, your operating system and with whom you need to share paths, you may need to adjust this parameter to easily copy paths. This will basically change all forward slash / to backslash \\ and add some when needed for Windows.

For example, to translate from `/isilon1/data/dm/tools/staging_files.xls` to `\\isilon1\data\dm\tools\staging_files.xls`

## <a id="clear_cache"></a>Clear Diskover Cache

A cache is used to store website content for performance purposes and is stored in the browser only. There are a few instances in which you will need to clear the cache, but it should be used as a last resort:
-  Sometimes the cache might prevent a browser-based software from working properly overtime and the cache needs to be cleared.
-  If you get a pop-up message on the Diskover interface asking you to clear the cache.

## <a id="clear_cookies"></a>Clear Diskover Cookies

- After a software update/upgrade to clear the cookies from the previous version that might affect the behavior of the new version.
- If you get a pop-up message on the Diskover interface asking you to clear the cookies.
