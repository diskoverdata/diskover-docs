**IMPORTANT!**

- Changing the settings are personal to your own web browser, even if you share a login account with others. Your customizations are stored as cookies. When you [clear the cookies](#clear_cookies) from the settings, your customized settings will also be cleared and reset to Diskover’s default values. 
- If you switch browsers, for example from Chrome to Safari, you will have to reselect your settings as they will not follow, again due to the settings being stored as cookies to a specific browser.
- Your cookies might also be cleared and need to be reselected after a software update.
- Click the following links to learn more about how [cookies](#clear_cookies) and [cache](#clear_cache) affect the Diskover user interface.

### Time Display

You can opt to change the time for your  **local time zone**  instead of  **UTC**  (Coordinated Universal Time).  We strongly recommend you select/click the **Show times in local timezone** so there will be no confusions when you look at the indexing time for example. Your selection will be saved automatically.

This change will affect the [storage time of your indices](#indices), file date creation, modification, etc.

### File Size Display

___
### Path Translations for Copying Paths

Depending on how your System Administrator configured Diskover, your operating system, and with whom you need to share paths, you may need to adjust this parameter to easily copy paths. This will basically change all forward slash / to backslash \\ and add some when needed for Windows.

For example, to translate from `/isilon1/data/dm/tools/staging_files.xls` to `\\isilon1\data\dm\tools\staging_files.xls`

<p id="clear_cache"></p>

___
### Clear Diskover Cache

A cache is used to store website content for performance purposes and is stored in the browser only. There are a few instances in which you will need to clear the cache, but it should be used as a last resort:

-  Sometimes the cache might prevent a browser-based software from working properly overtime and the cache needs to be cleared.
-  If you get a pop-up message on the Diskover interface asking you to clear the cache.

<p id="clear_cookies"></p>

___
### Clear Diskover Cookies

Cookies  are used by the browser to store user’s preferences, like the personal settings described in this chapter, and are stored in both server and browser. There are a few instances in which you may need to clear the cookies:
- After a software update/upgrade to clear the cookies from the previous version that might affect the behavior of the new version.
- If you get a pop-up message on the Diskover interface asking you to clear the cookies.

Clearing the cookies  will also remove the customized settings discussed in this chapter and that you might have previously selected.
