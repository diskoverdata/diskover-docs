## Media Attributes
___

Media attributes, like file resolution, codec, etc., are harvested during indexing and are therefore available to enhance in-depth searches and deliver accurate results.

___
### Hide/Unhide Media Info Column in Search Results Pane

When using the file search page, you have access to a column with all the media attributes. If you cannot see that column, it means that it is hidden. To unhide that column, go to  **Settings**  >  **Hide fields in search results**  > unclick the box in front of  **media_info**.

The  **media_info** column will then be available within the search results pane. If the column is visible but there are no attributes for a file, this means that there was no media metadata associated with the source file to begin with.

### View Detailed Media Attributes

Below is an example of the location where you can see detailed media attributes. You can access this page by clicking on a file in the search results pane or wherever you see the magnifying glass icon:

### Search on Media Attributes

The media attributes are part of the metadata harvested exclusively by the AJA Diskover Media Edition. If a file at the source doesnâ€™t include any of these attributes, it goes without saying that no details will be harvested and/or be available.

In addition to the [manual search syntax explained in the Diskover User Guide](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#search_syntax), the AJA Diskover Media Edition allows end-users to search on media specific attributes.

- As media fieldsâ€™ info can be complex, unless you know exactly what you are looking for, we strongly recommend using the [* wild card](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#wild-card) for ease of searching and to expand your results.

- The fields described below are meant to be copied/pasted/edited in the search bar of the Diskover user interface.

- Searching on **media_info** fields is case insensitive.

- The following syntax needs to be respected `media_info.key:value`:
    * **media_info** is not a variable.
    * **key** is a variable like resolution, codec, pixel format, etc.
    * **value** is a variable as per the examples below.


#### File resolution
Field name: **media_info.resolution**
> ```
> media_info.resolution:3840x2160
> ```
> ðŸ”Ž _Would only look for this specific resolution._


>```
>media_info.resolution:*1080*
>``` 

      ðŸ”Ž Would return all files with **1080** being part of the resolution, either width or height.

#### Codec
Field name: **media_info.codec**
>`media_info.codec:prores`
>
>`media_info.codec:h264`

#### Codec long
Field name: **media_info.codeclong**
>`media_info.codeclong:*apple*`
>
>`media_info.codeclong:*quicktime*`

#### Pixel format
Field name: **media_info.pixfmt**
>`media_info.pixfmt:*yuv*`
>
>`media_info.pixfmt:*422*`

#### Frames
Field name: **media_info.frames**
>`media_info.frames:30`
>
>`media_info.frames:*30*`
>
> _Note: Use a specific number only if you know the exact number of frames a file would have, otherwise use the * to expand your results._

#### Duration
Field name: **media_info.pixfmt**

_Note: This field will eventually reads time in this format **hh:mm:ss**, but is currently showing duration in seconds, ex: 30.5071 = 30 seconds and 5071 milliseconds)_

>`media_info.duration:30.*`
>
>_Note: Use the * if youâ€™re looking for a file for which you know the duration is 30 seconds but the milliseconds are unknown._

#### Framerate
Field name: **media_info.framerate**
>`media_info.framerate:*23*`
>
>_Note: Would return all files with standard framerate of 23.976_

#### Bitrate
Field name: **media_info.bitrate**
>`media_info.bitrate:*765*`
>
>_Note: Bitrate is a difficult field to search on, but not impossible._

___
### Search on Media Info Fields with Operators
Operators **and, or, not** are explained in the [Diskover User Guide](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#operators), but here are a few query examples using media info fields with operators:

>`media_info.resolution:1920x1080 AND media_info.codeclong:*quicktime*`
>
>_Would find all files with resolution 1920x1080 with QuickTime in codeclong._
 

>`*jurassic* NOT media_info.resolution:*1080*`
>
>_Woud find all files containing "jurassic" in the file name and/or path, but with any other resolution beside 1080 being part of that field._
 

>`media_info.resolution:*1080* AND mov NOT mp4`
>
>_Would find all files with 1080 being part of the resolution and with file extension .mov, but would exclude file extension .mp4 from the results._
 

>`media_info.pixfmt:*444* OR media_info.pixfmt:*422*`
>
>_Would find all files with pixel format either containing 444 or 422._

___
### Media Info Fields Containing Error or Warning

If the media fields at the source are corrupted and/or Diskover determines the file as "suspect", the media info fields will show either **error** or **warning** within Diskover. Beloware search queries to either exclude or pinpoint files with those values:

To search all files with valid media info fields while excluding files with *error* and *warning*:
>`media_info:* NOT (media_info.error:* OR media_info.warning:*)`

To search all files with media info fields containing *error* and *warning*:
>`media_info.error:* OR media_info.warning:*`
