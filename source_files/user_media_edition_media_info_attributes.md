## Media Attributes
___

Media attributes, like file resolution, codec, pixel format, etc., are harvested during indexing and are therefore available to enhance in-depth searches and deliver accurate results.

### Hide/Unhide Media Info Column in Search Results Pane

When using the file search page, you have access to a column with all the media attributes. If you cannot see that column, it means that it is hidden. To unhide that column, go to  **Settings**  >  **Hide fields in search results**  > unclick the box in front of  **media_info**.

The  **media_info** column will then be available within the search results pane. If the column is visible but there are no attributes for a file, this means that there was no media metadata associated with the source file to begin with.

### View Detailed Media Attributes

Below is an example of the location where you can see detailed media attributes. You can access this page by clicking on a file in the search results pane or wherever you see the magnifying glass icon:

### General Notes on Searching Media Attributes

The media attributes are part of the metadata harvested exclusively by the AJA Diskover Media Edition. If a file at the source doesnâ€™t include any of these attributes, it goes without saying that no details will be harvested and/or be available.

In addition to the [manual search syntax explained in the Diskover User Guide](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#search_syntax), the AJA Diskover Media Edition allows end-users to search on media specific attributes.

- As media fieldsâ€™ info can be complex, unless you know exactly what you are looking for, we strongly recommend using the [* wild card](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#wild-card) for ease of searching and to expand your results.

- The fields described below are meant to be copied/pasted/edited in the search bar of the Diskover user interface.

___
### Search Syntax

- The following syntax needs to be respected `media_info.key:value`:
    * **media_info** is not a variable.
    * **key** is a variable like resolution, codec, pixel format, etc.
    * **value** is a variable as per the examples below.

- Searching on **media_info** fields is case insensitive.

___
### Media Info Fields Containing Error or Warning

If the media fields at the source are corrupted and/or Diskover determines the file as "suspect", the media info fields will show either **error** or **warning** within Diskover. Below are search queries to either exclude or pinpoint files with those values:

To search all files with valid media info fields while excluding files with **error** and **warning**:

```
media_info:* NOT (media_info.error:* OR media_info.warning:*)
```

To search all files with media info fields containing **error** and **warning**:

```
media_info.error:* OR media_info.warning:*
```

___
### Search on Media Info Fields with Operators
Operators **and, or, not** are explained in the [Diskover User Guide](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#operators), but here are a few query examples using media info fields with operators. Note that operators are not case sensitive, but they are being typed in capital letters below for visual only.

#### AND Operator

```
media_info.resolution:1920x1080 and media_info.codeclong:*quicktime*
```

> ðŸ”Ž _Would find all files with resolution 1920x1080 with QuickTime in codeclong._
 
#### NOT Operator

```
*jurassic* NOT media_info.resolution:*1080*
```

> ðŸ”Ž _Woud find all files containing **jurassic** in the file name and/or path, with resolution excluding 1080._
 
 
#### OR Operator

```
*jurassic* (media_info.pixfmt:*444* OR media_info.pixfmt:*422*)
```

> ðŸ”Ž _Woud find all files containing **jurassic** in the file name and/or path with pixel format either containing 444 or 422._

#### Mixing Operators

```
(media_info.resolution:*1080* or media_info.resolution:*1920*) AND extension:mov NOT extension:mp4
```

> ðŸ”Ž _Would find all files with 1080 or 1920 being part of the resolution, with file extension .mov, but would exclude file extension .mp4 from the results._
