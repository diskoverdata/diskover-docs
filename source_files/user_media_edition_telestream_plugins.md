### Submit Transcoding Jobs to Vantage Direclty from Diskover

The Diskover Telestream Vantage Plugin allows end-users to submit files for transcoding directly from the Diskover user interface. This process can be utilized by all end-users without needing access to the production tools and source files.

The major benefits:

- The plugin eliminates many steps from going back and forth between the two softwares.
- Vantage offers several transcoding options which can be confusing to non-technical users > the plugin allows for limiting the number of options to only the ones relevant to the end-users.
- Creating a Vantage account for an end-user is intensive as it requires complex and time consuming configurations > single end-user accounts for Vantage are not required with the plugin as all they need is access to Diskover.
- End-users with a Vantage account also means that they have access to your production network > the plugin keeps your network secure as the end-users only have access to read-only information via Diskover.
- Files are very easy to find within Diskoverâ€™s global index compared to Vantage where one needs to know where to look.
- The learning curve is quick and easy for new end-users.

#### Steps to Submit a File for Transcoding

1. [Search for the desired file(s) within Diskover](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_user_guide/#manual-search-syntax) as you would normaly do.
 
2. Select the file you wish to submit for transcoding by clicking the **File Action > submit to Vantage** icon (gears icon) in line with the file.
