### Vantage | Submit Transcoding Jobs Directly from Diskover

#### [🍿 Watch Demo Video | Telestream Vantage](https://vimeo.com/669672933)

The Diskover Telestream Vantage Plugin allows end-users to submit files for transcoding directly from the Diskover user interface. This process can be utilized by all end-users without needing access to the production tools and source files.

The major benefits:

- The plugin eliminates many steps from going back and forth between the two software.
- Vantage offers several transcoding options which can be confusing to non-technical users > the plugin allows for limiting the number of options to only the ones relevant to the end users.
- Creating a Vantage account for an end-user is intensive as it requires complex and time-consuming configurations > single end-user accounts for Vantage are not required with the plugin as all they need is access to Diskover.
- End-users with a Vantage account also means that they have access to your production network > the plugin keeps your network secure as the end-users only have access to read-only information via Diskover.
- Files are very easy to find within Diskover’s global index compared to Vantage where one needs to know where to look.
- The learning curve is quick and easy for new end-users.

#### How to Submit a File for Transcoding

- 1 → Search for the desired file(s) within Diskover as you would normally do.
- 2 → You can launch transcoding jobs by first selecting a single file or multiple files in the results pane and then selecting **File Action → submit to Vantage**:
