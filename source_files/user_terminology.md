## Terminology
___

Although the terms described in this section may have slightly different interpretations in other contexts, they are defined here within the Diskover end-user environment.

<p id="data_curation"></p>

### Data Curation

Data curation is the practice of managing data collected from various sources as a valuable asset to unlock its potential and organization. Managing data effectively requires having a data strategy and reliable methods to access, integrate, cleanse, govern, store, and prepare data for analytics. The value of the data is maintained over time and remains available for reuse and preservation.

<p id="storage_volume"></p>

___
### Volume

A storage location that you want to index, for example: Windows Share/drive, Linux mount/NFS Export, cloud storage/S3 bucket, etc.

Examples of other names for volume that might be used in your organization: storage volume, storage mount, mount point, top level path, top level storage directory.

<p id="index"></p>

___
### Index/Indices

An index is an inventory of all the files on a volume; it allows the data to be searched quickly via the index instead of the operating system "find commands". Both  **indexes**  and  **indices**  have the same meaning, and are the plural of index, although indices is usually preferred in a technical context.

- You can have multiple inventories/indices of a storage volume at different times.
- Indices typically contain directory name, file name, file size, creation date, modify date, owner, etc.
- Diskoverâ€™s software populates the indices with additional metadata and makes these attributes searchable, pushing the searches, reporting, and workflows to a higher level of business and schedule awareness. For example:
	- Adds business context (job status, client #, project manager, etc.)
	- Adds media info attributes for media files (resolution, codec, framerate, etc.)

<p id="directory"></p>

___
### Directory/Folder

There are very subtle differences between a directory and a folder, but in the context of this guide, they are interchangeable and have the same meaning: a container to store/organize other directories/folders and files.

<p id="path"></p>

___
### Path

The complete location/name where a dictory or a file is located, for example:

`/mnt/lucidlink/projects/Pistachio/WonderfulPistachios_GangnamStyle.mov`

<p id="recursive"></p>

___
### Recursive and Non-Recursive

**Non-Recursive**: Will search or apply action exclusively to the path/directory you are pointing to.

**Recursive**: Will search or apply action to the path/directory, as well as all sub-directories and files, inside that path.

<p id="hardlinks"></p>

___
### Hard links

A hardlink is a pointer/link that acts like a folder/directory. A hard link is a link that directly associates a name with a given file in an operating system. Unlike a soft link, which changes the pointer when the file is renamed, a hard link still points to the underlying file even if the file name changes.

Think of hard links like copies but they dont use up any more disk space. Hard links are different than symbolic or soft links, those are more just pointers or links to the actual file.

**Soft links**:
	- Can cross the file system.
	- Allows you to link between directories.
	- Has different inode number and file permissions than original file.
	- Permissions will not be updated.
	- Has only the path of the original file, not the contents.

**Hard links**:

	- A hard link is a directory that associates a name with a file, thus each file must have at least one hard link.
	- You can only hard link files and not directories.
	- Hard links can only refer to files within the same volume/file system, they can't cross the file system boundaries.
	- Has the same inode number and permissions of original file.
	- Permissions will be updated if the permissions of source file is changed.
	- Has the actual contents of the original file, so that you still can view the contents, even if the original file moved or removed.
	- You can't free up disk space until all the hard links and original files are deleted, as they all reference same inode.

>ðŸ”† &nbsp;Hard links are used a lot in media and entertainment so that digital assets can be referenced in different shot folders without using additional space.

### Elasticsearch

Diskover uses Elasticsearch in the backend for its speed and reliability. Below is an overview of the Diskover architecture.
