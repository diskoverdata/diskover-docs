### Storage Volume

A storage location that you want to index, for example: Windows Share/drive, Linux mount/NFS Export, cloud storage, S3 bucket, etc.

Examples of other names for storage volume that might be used in your organization: storage mount, mount point, top level path, top level storage directory, volume.

<p id="index"></p>

___
### Index/Indices

An index is an inventory of all the files on a storage volume; it allows the data to be searched quickly via the index instead of the operating system  find commands. Both  **indexes**  and  **indices**  have the same meaning, and are the plural of index, although indices is usually preferred in a technical context.

- You can have multiple inventories/indices of a storage volume at different times.
- Indices typically contain directory name, file name, file size, creation date, modify date, owner, etc.
- Diskoverâ€™s software populates the indices with additional metadata  and makes these attributes searchable, pushing the searches and reporting to a higher level of business and schedule awareness:
	- Adds business context.
	- Adds schedule context.
	- Allow searches on image attributes for media files (resolution, frame rate, color bits), etc.

### Directory/Folder

There are very subtle differences between a directory and a folder, but in the context of this guide, they are interchangeable and have the same meaning: a container to store/organize other directories/folders and files.

<p id="recursive"></p>

___
### Recursive and Non-Recursive

**Non-Recursive**: Will search or apply action to only the path/directory/file you are pointing to.

**Recursive**: Will search or apply action to the path/directory, as well as all sub-directories and files, inside that path.
