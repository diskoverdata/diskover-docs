## Optional Visualization Tools
___

You can optionally use other visualization tools to read the Elasticsearch metadata catalog besides Diskover-Web. Diskover does not technically support these optional tools, and only Kibana is described in this section.

### Using Kibana in Addition to Diskover-Web

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Install the latest version of Kibana and keep up to date with patches, security enhancements, etc. as new versions are released:
```
yum install -y https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-7.12.0-x86_64.rpm
vi /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Uncomment and set the following line:
```
server.host: "<host ip>"
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Uncomment and set the following line if Elasticsearch is not listening on localhost:
```
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://<es host ip>:9200"]
```

ðŸ”´ &nbsp;Set firewall rules:
```
firewall-cmd --add-port=5601/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
systemctl enable kibana.service
systemctl start kibana.service
systemctl status kibana.service
```

For securing Elasticsearch and Kibana, follow this user guide to set up security, as by default, Elasticsearch has no security enabled:
